<h3>Introduction to Scholarly Inquiry<br />Unit 1</h3>

Unit 1 will provide you with a general introduction to inquiry, familiarizing you with foundational concepts related to scholarly inquiry. In particular, this unit will focus on the philosophical foundations of research, the connection between leadership and scholarly inquiry, and what evidence-based leadership looks like. By the end of the unit, you will understand the importance of Boyer’s Model of Scholarship and begin to evaluate the decision-making processes that you utilize in your professional life.

<h3>Developing Your Professional Voice<br />Unit 3</h3>

An essential attribute of scholarly work is that of writing well. Writing well involves several components. Some are conceptual—reasoning and developing a logical argument. Others reflect the mechanics of good written communication—organization of a manuscript, style and language use, grammar, spelling, and punctuation. APA formatting also falls within this category of the mechanics of writing well. The MA Leadership program uses the APA Manual (6th edition) as the model for formatting written work formally submitted. Unit 3 is devoted to helping you become familiar with some of the more common elements of scholarly writing and APA style.

<h3>An Introduction to Research Reports<br />Unit 4</h3>

In unit 4 we are going to find out about research reports. To start, we will focus on understanding the common elements found in the introduction of research reports. We will be engaging with the research problem, the review of precedent literature, and the research purpose. Although the terms “research problem” and “research purpose” sound similar, we will see that although related, they are quite different.

<h3>Understanding Quantitative Research Reports<br />Unit 5</h3>

In unit 5 we want to extend this to the next major section of a research report: the methods and results. In this unit, we will see that the methods section indicates the overall plan for how the research was conducted, how the data was collected, and what the analysis of the data tells us. These may be termed research design, method, and analysis and results, respectively. Because of significant differences in quantitative and qualitative methods, we will break this discussion into two units. This unit will focus on the methods and results of quantitative research reports, while unit 6 will focus on those of qualitative research reports.

<h3>Understanding Qualitative Research Reports<br />Unit 6</h3>

In unit 6 we continue our overview of the most common research methods used in leadership research. Remember that the purpose of these overviews is that you will be a more informed consumer of research and a practitioner of evidence-based leadership practices. Specifically, this unit will focus on the research design, method, and analysis and results of qualitative research reports.

<h3>Understanding Mixed Methods Research Reports<br />Unit 7</h3>

Plano-Clark and Creswell assert that the decision to engage in qualitative or quantitative research is driven by whether the research problem calls for an explanation or an exploration (2015, p. 63). A third genre—mixed methods—has developed. Mixed methods is the conscious inclusion of both qualitative and quantitative methods and so doing, seeks to mitigate some of the inherent tensions and weaknesses in both. In unit 7 we will investigate mixed methods research design.

<h3>Action Research: Studies that Solve Practical Problems<br />Unit 8</h3>

We want to shift our focus from the highly theoretical and rigidly structured forms of formal research that we have considered thus far and look at a form of research that you are more likely to employ as a leader—action research. Action research has evolved as a method well suited to leadership and organizational studies as well as in educational settings. In unit 8 we will explore how action research is related to, and yet distinct from, other forms of research that we have explored to date. If formal research approaches (qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods) are aimed at generating new knowledge, action research is aimed at finding solutions to local problems and issues.

<h3>Conclusions of Research Reports<br />Unit 9</h3>

In unit 9 we focus on assessing and interpreting the discussion/conclusion section of a research report. The discussion section is where loose threads are gathered together, and in particular, the author looks backward and distills into a few succinct paragraphs what the particular research has accomplished. All significant aspects of the research report are brought together in proper perspective, including relating the findings or results to the conclusions. Above all, a good discussion makes explicit how the findings or results support the conclusions.

<h3>Bringing It All Together<br />Unit 10</h3>

“So I turned my mind to understand, to investigate and to search out wisdom…” (Ecclesiastes 7:25)</p>

Scholarly research reports can have profound impact on society. Thus far in this course we have been making the case that best practices are informed by the wise and judicious application of research findings to particular situations. In unit 10 we will be bringing things to a close through several experiential learning activities.
