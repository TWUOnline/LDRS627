<h2>Topic 1: Reflective Practice and Teaching perspectives</h2>

<strong>Introduction</strong> We begin this topic by taking a look at your ideas about teaching and learning and how these relate to the role of the teacher and learner in adult education. Think about your experience as a student. What helped you be an engaged learner? What are the differences between teaching and learning adults and teaching and learning children or adolescents? An adult educator needs to assume that participants have prior knowledge and experience and that adults are very interested in the application of whatever they are learning. Keeping in mind these principles of andragogy (adult teaching and learning; as opposed to pedagogy, child and adolescent teaching and learning) will help you become a facilitator of learning.

<h3>Learning Activities</h3>

<h4>Activity 1: Teaching Practices Inventory</h4>

Take the <a href="http://www.teachingperspectives.com/tpi/">Teaching Practices Inventory</a>. It has 45 questions and should take you about 10-15 minutes to complete.

<h4>Activity 2: Videos and Blog</h4>

View the following videos that will help you interpret your TPI results.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://youtu.be/9GN7nN6YnXg">TPI as a conversational Tool</a></li>
<li><a href="http://youtu.be/1oz1oPE34OM">Orientation to a Profile</a></li>
<li><a href="http://youtu.be/EHy76iHn3Ls">Deconstructing a Profile</a></li>
<li><a href="http://youtu.be/4IB7OhP6k28">Next Steps</a></li>
</ul>

Using the videos as a guide, interpret your own TPI results focusing on your dominant perspectives. Then complete part A of your blog. <strong>Answer the following questions in your blog:</strong> a) Does your profile match your self-perception or how others see you? Are there any discrepancies? b) With respect to teaching adults, what are your <a href="https://learn.twu.ca/mod/url/view.php?id=36727">next steps</a>?

<h2>Topic 2: Critical and Transformative Learning</h2>

<strong>Introduction</strong> <strong>What kind of focus will you have as an educator? What techniques will you use to ensure your students have a meaningful learning experience?</strong> If you keep a learner-centered focus you will be more attracted to choosing methods that will facilitate critical thinking and this will potentially lead to transformations in the perspectives and lives of your learners. On Jan. 9, 2017 MA LEAD student Christel Davidson wrote the following post entitled ‘Designing Our Boxes’ for another course. I quote it here, with her permission. _“__Critical transformational learning is a holistic learning practice that helps people to crawl out of their boxes, experience the space outside the box and then reconstruct their next box which in turn they will crawl out of again and repeat over and over again. I say they will reconstruct their box each time because as human beings we need boundaries to our thought, actions and emotions, and without them, we become unsure of whether anything is concrete or valid, so to feel safe we have our boxes. This is perfectly alright as long as we don't get stuck in the same box forever._ _The value of critical transformational learning is that there is a personal intentionality to the process. This can be guided by an educator or it can happen independently. Each time the learner temporarily exits the box to take a fresh view of life, it is not to throw the person into a state of chaos or abandonment of absolutes, but to give a moment where thoughts can be free to explore other possible points of view or to reflect on habits and unconscious actions that are rooted in their beliefs. Once challenged or left open for review, a critical analysis can be made, conclusions drawn and a shifted belief or value stabilized, by restating or redesigning their box._ _There are endless ways that this can be accomplished, so long as the process evokes the emotions, stimulates the soul and matures the mind.”_ Critical thinking is an essential component of leadership because there is an intelligence to practice. This practical wisdom or phronesis is an intellectual virtue incorporating discernment and judgment and is enhanced through practice. How does one learn through practice? According to Cahalan (2016) there are eight _Ways_ _of_ _Knowing_ essential to wise practice:

<ul>
<li>Situated awareness</li>
<li>Embodied realizing</li>
<li>Conceptual understanding</li>
<li>Critical thinking</li>
<li>Emotional attunement</li>
<li>Creative insight</li>
<li>Spiritual discernment</li>
<li>Practical reasoning</li>
</ul>

Experiential learning can lead to wisdom if experience is accompanied by critical thinking and intentionally grounded in values and beliefs about what is good. This wisdom is transformational both personally and professionally.

<h2>Topic 3: Roles and Factors Impacting Adult Educators</h2>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong> Adult educators are impacted by various societal factors because adult education happens in the world! The key is helping participants analyze their experience critically, and figuring out how what they are learning 'fits' or challenges their lived experience. Adult educators are encouraged to establish authentic relationships with students by building trust through caring for students, respecting them and showing interest in what is important to them. One of my favorite things to remember is that the teaching is not about me, it is about the students’ learning. In anything I do as a teacher, I should ask myself “How does this contribute to the students’ learning? It is helpful to reflect on Brazilian philosopher, Rubem Alves (1979) comments that everything is interpretation: “Language functions as a mediation tool between humans and their world. As humans, we don’t contemplate reality face to face. Since birth, things in our world don’t come to us in their naked form, but always dressed up in the names our community has given them. This community has already defined how and what the world is like and, therefore, already knows it (the world). This knowledge of the world is crystallized in our language. Language, therefore, is not a copy of objects and facts. Language is always interpretation” (cited in Goodson 2013, p.47). Eventually you will be able to help your students engage in the demanding tasks of reflection, critical analysis and academic thinking and writing with less effortful deliberation.

<h3>Learning Activities</h3>

Activity 4: KWL Chart [Kelly please put this chart on the home page of the course site. It will be an ongoing activity - every other week eg 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 so that it alternates with the Reading Response assignments due weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.]

Know

Want to know

Learned

Considering the roles and factors impacting adult educators, add to the KWL chart. A KWL chart is a graphic organizer that helps us jot down our ideas about what we know, what we want to know, and what we have learned. This chart is one that all course participants will contribute to throughout the ten week course in weeks 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9. This week, answer, in point form , the following questions in the chart: What do you KNOW about the role of an adult educator and factors impacting adult educators? What do you WANT TO KNOW about the role of an adult educator and factors impacting adult educators? What have you LEARNED so far about the role of an adult educator and factors impacting adult educators?
