<h1>Topic 1: Authentic Individualism</h1>
<strong>Introduction</strong>

Canadian contemporary philosopher Charles Taylor’s views on the secular age and individualism help to explain authentic individualism.  Taylor defines a secular age as a time largely devoid of hierarchical order and a general "flattening" of society<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[i]</a> when all goals beyond human flourishing are eclipsed and individualism overwhelms the common good<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2">[ii]</a>. People used to see themselves as part of a larger order that gave meaning and purpose to their lives. However, this is not the reality of most people in a secular age.

Generally the emphasis for the majority of people in a secular age is self, self-fulfillment, recognition and accomplishment. People in a secular age, Taylor argues, are consequently less concerned with others and society and there is less civic engagement. This does not negate the large public responses to tragedies that are indeed wonderful examples of people coming together through suffering.  Taylor’s point is to say that daily life in a secular world is more individualistic than communal.  His explanation reveals that most people lack a guiding philosophy that informs decisions and social networks, and that there is, rather, a focus on neutrality and an ethic of libertarian thinking where “people should be permitted to run their own lives as they wish [and] nobody would [have] a right to force his way of life upon his neighbor.” <a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3">[iii]</a>  This is not individualism that serves the common good. Forcing a way of life does not sound desirable in any case, but Taylor contends that excessive individualism goes as far as to say that people in a secular age generally let other people lead their own lives and do not necessarily see a common responsibility to intervene or help them – that’s the more impersonal role of government. For Taylor, individualism is the primary "malaise of modernity"<a href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4">[iv]</a>, since it is inherently inegalitarian; not everyone has equal access to the "good life." Self-determination, a focus on efficiency and instrumental reasoning overwhelm a sense of true authenticity, purpose beyond the self and concern for the common good.

In contrast to excessive individualism, <em>authentic individualism</em> refers to people who know who they are in a deeper sense and, furthermore, know what they believe to be important, have a sense of purpose beyond themselves and are motivated by service to the growth and betterment of others.  This servant leadership approach seeks to transform the challenges of competing needs into a community. An authentic individual sees themselves as part of the larger whole and is therefore not only concerned for their own interests. They are concerned about fairness to protect equal chances for everyone, and they get involved in processes to determine what the community as a whole desires.

<strong>Activity 8.1 </strong>

Reflect on and journal about these topics:
<ul>
 	<li>What dispositions does an individual who desires to be authentic need to foster?</li>
 	<li>What are the challenges of leadership faced even by well-intentioned leaders?</li>
 	<li>Do you agree with Taylor that individualism is the primary "malaise of modernity"?</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>Activity 8.2</strong>

Read this blog post: <a href="https://www.bigquestionsonline.com/2013/12/10/how-does-humility-contribute-strength/">Baehr, J. (2013) <em>How does humility contribute to strength?</em></a> and focus on humility’s role in authentic individualism: moral, intellectual and civic. What five steps does Baehr say a teacher can take to foster intellectual humility in the classroom setting?

<strong><em> </em></strong>

<strong>Activity 8.3</strong>

Read the following article and consider the author’s assertion that “adult education has an explicit, emancipatory, critical and transformatory role.”  Do you agree?  Why or why not?  Jot down a few notes for possible inclusion in your blog post described under Topic 2.

<h1><strong>
</strong>Topic 2: The adult educator as agent for social transformation.</h1>
<strong>Introduction</strong>

An essential question for adult educators to reflect on is: <em>What matters to me and how can my work advance this in some way?</em>  Discovering and acting upon a purpose beyond oneself brings meaning to work and can motivate learners to find meaning also.  This leads to a deeper commitment and sense of fulfillment.  Having a greater purpose creates unity and fights fragmentation in the activities of life.   The words of Jean Vanier are a call to action for all adult educators:

<strong> </strong>

It is always good for individuals, communities and indeed nations, to remember that their present situation is a result of the thousands of gestures of love or hate that came before. This obliges us to remember that the community of tomorrow is being born of our fidelity to the present. We discover that we are at the same time very insignificant and very important because each of our actions is preparing the humanity of tomorrow; it is a tiny contribution to the huge and glorious final humanity. (Vanier, 1989, p.152)

What we value, we prioritize and this directs our work and lives, shaping not just what we do but who we become. We need to start practicing now who we want to be in the future (Bregman, P., 2016).  Adult educators can choose to play a role in personal transformation and social change.

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Activity 8.4: Read &amp; Reflect</strong>

Read the following article.  Referring to Silberman and/or your own ideas, answer this question in your journal:  How can an adult educator help learners identify their personal moral values while also gaining cultural awareness of the moral values in various world religions and secular humanism?
