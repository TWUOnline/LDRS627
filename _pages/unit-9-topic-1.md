<h2>Blog Assignment</h2>
In the Brookfield <a href="http://youtu.be/Y8umk4w8kB8%20%20Critical%20Thinking">video</a> you viewed in week 5 and considering this week's reading, how do Brookfield and Silberman advise instructors to challenge student assumptions and model the exploration of alternative perspectives?

<strong> </strong>
<h2>Assignment: Adult Lesson Design - Peer Review</h2>
Post a draft of your Adult Lesson Design assignment for peer review .

Respond to your assigned colleague’s Draft Adult Lesson design.

Peer review pairing will be given in advance.

Your peer review should be collegial and address issues like grammar and structure as well as the quality of arguments and evidence presented in the paper. Use the rubric as a guide and give suggestions accordingly.

Please remember!
<ul>
 	<li>Be Kind: Always treat others with dignity and respect. This means we never use words that are hurtful, including sarcasm.</li>
 	<li>Be Specific: Focus on particular strengths and weaknesses, rather than making general comments like “It’s good” or “I like it.” Provide insight into why it is good or what, specifically, you like about it.</li>
 	<li>Be Helpful: The goal is to positively contribute to the individual or the group, not to simply be heard. Echoing the thoughts of others or cleverly pointing out details that are irrelevant wastes time.</li>
 	<li>Participate: Peer critique is a process to support each other, and your feedback is valued!</li>
 	<li>When critiquing a peer’s work, use “I” statements. For example, “I’m confused by this part,” rather than “This part makes no sense.”</li>
 	<li>Use questions whenever possible. For example, “I’m curious why you chose to begin with…?”, or “Did you consider adding…?”</li>
</ul>
Remember the three important phrases:

“I notice….”

“I wonder….”

<h1>Checking your Learning</h1>
Use the learning outcomes for this unit as a checklist of understanding before you move to the next unit.
<ul>
 	<li>Can you describe how to facilitate discussion, get learners engaged with a topic and encourage them to have confidence to speak in class and share their ideas?</li>
 	<li>Can you articulate a vision of education where educators and students alike become agents of transformation?</li>
</ul>
