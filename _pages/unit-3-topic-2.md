<h2>Assessment</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>Write a blog on this topic: Considering how change, chance, complexity and uncertainty impact adult education and life-long learning, what actions can you take to design learning experiences that respect body, spirit, and emotions - as related to your context?</li>
 	<li>Once you have written your post, take some time to find a picture or video that relates to the ideas you have presented.  Add this picture/video to your blog and if it's not evident, explain it's relation to the concepts in this unit.  Be sure to attribute the source of the material by adding a full citation.</li>
 	<li>Once you have published your blog online, be sure to respond to at least two others' blog posts.</li>
</ol>
<em>Substantive responses may include: </em>
<ul>
 	<li>Providing a new thought, idea, or perspective;</li>
 	<li>Citing an experience or example of what we are learning;</li>
 	<li>Adding a new twist on a perspective;</li>
 	<li>Critically thinking about an idea/concept;</li>
 	<li>Questioning or challenging a principle/perspective;</li>
 	<li>Asking a question or making a comment that shows you are interested in what another person says or encourages another person to elaborate on something they have already said;</li>
 	<li>Sharing a resource (a reading, web link, video) not covered in the syllabus that adds new information or perspectives to our learning;</li>
 	<li>Making a comment that underscores the link between two people’s contributions and making this link explicit in your comment. Or making a summary observation that takes into account several people’s contributions and that touches on a recurring theme in the discussion.</li>
</ul>
What Substantive Participation is <strong>NOT:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Very basic comments such as “I agree” or “I disagree;”</li>
 	<li>Restating what has been said <em>(unless there is a direct purpose in doing so); </em></li>
 	<li>Disrespectfully disagreeing;</li>
 	<li>Pat answers that are not thought-provoking or do not move the dialogue forward;</li>
 	<li>Greetings/conversation better suited for the Virtual Collegium.</li>
</ul>
Below are examples of how to stimulate your own and others’ thinking:
<ul>
 	<li>What would happen if...</li>
 	<li>Other times it may be helpful to...</li>
 	<li>It is my understanding...what is your experience with this?</li>
 	<li>You might approach this from...</li>
 	<li>Is it possible that...</li>
 	<li>Would you consider...</li>
 	<li>Maybe...</li>
 	<li>Possibly...</li>
 	<li>Sometimes...</li>
 	<li>I'm wondering if...</li>
 	<li>Do you think...</li>
</ul>

<h3>Checking your Learning</h3>
Use the learning outcomes for this unit as a checklist of understanding before you move to the next unit.
<ul>
 	<li>Can you explain why being comfortable with ambiguity and challenged by what others think is central to learning as an adult?</li>
 	<li>Can you design brain-friendly teaching methods that increase motivation to learn?</li>
</ul>
