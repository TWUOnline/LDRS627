<h2>Topic 2:</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
In topic 1 we established that emotions are related to change, innovation and learning.

In chapter 11 of the Wang text, Kcenia O’Neil explores the neuroscience behind emotions and learning: “illustrating the interdependency of cognition and emotion in the brain in which emotion is the ‘rudder’ guiding thought in learning” (p.278). As a result, we as adult educators are encouraged to design ways to teach that include more sensory-engaging pedagogies.

This is definitely different from teaching according to Bloom’s taxonomy in order to meet learning outcomes and a far cry from teaching via <strong>PowerPoint</strong>, reading and discussion upon which so much of adult learning is based. With you, I am challenged to explore social-emotional learning and sensory-engaging pedagogies.  How can we incorporate the senses of sight, sound, smell, taste and touch into our teaching? It is a work in progress!
<h3>Learning Activities
Activity 3:</h3>
As you read the assigned material for this unit listed below, think about this question: Do you have any experience in a teaching and learning setting where you were able to engage with more senses than hearing and seeing? What was it like? Did you feel more engaged through that experience?
