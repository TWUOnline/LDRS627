### Unit 2
##### Overview

Teachers have power!  Students have power!  <strong>They (?)</strong> dynamic interplay between these <strong>participants</strong> in a learning environment can create <strong>either </strong>a positive, safe and authentic experience<strong>,</strong> or one wrought with tension, confusion and ‘second guessing’.  Part of preparing to be an adult educator is being aware of your power as well as the power among students<strong>,</strong> and between students and you. Why is it necessary to know about this?  Because adults (and that includes both the educator and the participants) have a lifetime of experiences, ideas, prejudices, misinformation, biases, and brilliance that they bring to the learning environment and these all impact learning.

Consider for example how the topic of <em>Women in Leadership</em> might be received by various individuals: a woman from the Global South, a man from the Global South, a pastor, a millennial, a woman who has worked from home/not in the paid workforce, a business person, a health care provider….  There are so many possible receptions to this topic!  Navigating this <strong>(this what?  audience?) </strong>when you are planning requires consideration of power dynamics and participants’ realities as far as you know about them.  It takes personal research or self-directed learning and if done well, can lead to transformative experiences for both you and your participants.  I live a profound and genuine joy when I am learning with my students. This is how I know deeply that teaching is my vocation. <strong>(I just wanted to add a reminder here that we should add your bio to the course outline so students know whose voice they're hearing - as it may not be the same as their instructor).</strong>

Let me give you an example of power, self-directed learning and transformation that I experienced a few years ago.  At the time I was a newly hired faculty member <strong>for TWU </strong>and was excited to be invited to speak at an International Leadership Conference on the topic of Women in Leadership.  Imagine the challenge before me:  <strong>Here I was, a W</strong>estern woman, <strong>at an </strong>all-girls’ school in Chennai, India<strong>,</strong> where violence against women is rampant, <strong>and I was </strong>among feisty nuns/ faculty (<strong>should we say "among faculty who were fiesty nuns"? for clarity) </strong> intent on equipping ‘their girls’ to change India and make it more equitable and fair for women, their families and future generations.  I embraced the challenge as a personal self-directed learning endeavor, did as much research on the lived reality about who I imagined my participants at the conference to be, and planned to share my story and the research describing women in leadership over the past forty years. <strong>(should we add here how you changed your speech? or a major consideration?)</strong> I decided to take my then sixteen year old daughter with me for this amazing experience.  Having her there also influenced our reception in positive ways -  (power dynamics at play)!  Thankfully, the presentation was well received and my daughter and I learned so much from the research, enjoyed the kind hospitality of our hosts at the College and were astounded that approximately four hundred participants (mostly women) came to listen!  Preparing for the conference and taking that trip taught us about power dynamics, the value of self-directed learning and impacted our worldview.  Post-conference anecdotal feedback received from faculty at the college revealed that the participants too learned about power dynamics and the possibilities of critical transformation in their own lives and the society they hoped to influence.

You will explore these topics of power, critical transformational learning and prior learning assessment in this unit.

<strong>Learning Cafe (Adrienne, do you want students to complete this before Unit 2 topics or after? I've put the info also in the course overview and will add to the other units)</strong>

<strong>Before you continue with Unit 2, take a couple minutes to connect with other learners in the Learning Cafe.  You were introduced to this cafe in Unit 1 and shared a little about yourself.  This week, use the following prompt</strong> <strong>to get a new</strong> conversation going:  <em>What is the best advice you’ve ever received?</em>

## Topic 1: Critical Transformative Learning

### Introduction

With respect to transformative learning instructors need to:
<ol>
 	<li>Foster transformative learning through critical reflection; use non-rational media such as storytelling, embodied knowing, intuitive and affective, emotional, and spiritual experiences. Other non-rational tools are music, poetry, art, photography, literature, dreams, drama, fiction</li>
 	<li>Engage in/encourage dialogue or discourse and social interaction</li>
 	<li>Create a space that is open and welcoming to this type of learning: safe, open<strong>, and</strong> supportive<strong>. (took out dash)</strong></li>
</ol>
Transformative learning is not an individual process but rather a personal process that is carried out in ‘integrally webbed totalities’  <strong>(</strong>O’Sullivan: 2003, 337, cited on page 328 of <em>Contemporary Issues)<strong>(do you need all of this citation, or can we move some info to the Resources/References section?)</strong></em>. O’Sullivan believes we are part of a bigger picture.  As I sit here and type this, every decision I made that got me here had an impact on someone else.  As a result of this course or program, you may change the way you make decisions which in turn, affects all of the people in this web differently than they may have been impacted had you made the same decision today.

For learning to be transformative and effective it needs to be job-embedded, ongoing and with built-in follow-up and support. As was evidenced in the Hui, Snider, and Couture (2016) study, the most effective type of professional development for lasting change in a classroom is not a one-time workshop. Traditional stand-and-deliver professional development was conducted by Leblanc, Richardson, and Burns (2009) with minimal results. Effective professional development is instead an ongoing supportive relationship with in-class follow up and teacher choice and input as to the direction of needed development choice (Hui, Snider, Couture, 2016; Katz, 2013; Katz, 2014). Sokal and Sharma (2014), through their review of literature around effective professional development,<strong>(consider putting this part of the sentence first for more flow?)</strong> describe an ideal program as entailing between 30 and 100 hours of training hours spread over a span of six to 12 months, with in-house professional learning communities (PLCs) and coursework as part of the training.

```

###Learning Activity 1

While reading Brookfield chapter 1 consider especially how context constantly alters how a practice is put into effect.  Teaching is helping learning.

### Learning Activity 2

Blog post

Write 300 words (approximately) on the following:

a) Define critical transformational learning in your own words.

b) How can you as an adult education foster critical transformative learning in your context?
&lt;h2&gt;Topic 2: Pedagogy and Andragogy
### Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
Creating a good learning experience for adults is what andragogy is all about. It’s important to keep in mind that the resource of highest value in adult education is the learner’s experience.

Knowles (1980 cited in Merriam &amp; Bierma, 2014, p. 47), outlines six assumptions about andragogy:
&lt;ol&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;As a person matures, his or her self-concept moves from that of a dependent personality toward one of a self-directing human being.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;An adult accumulates a growing reservoir of experience, which is a rich resource for learning.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;The readiness of an adult to learn is closely related to the developmental tasks of his or her social role.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;There is a change in time perspective as people mature – from future application of knowledge to immediacy of application. Thus, an adult is more problem than subject centered in learning.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Adults are mostly driven by internal motivation, rather than external motivators&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Adults need to know the reason for learning something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
What is the difference between how children experience something as compared to how adults experience something?  In other words, what’s the difference between pedagogy and andragogy?

Children experience what happens &lt;em&gt;to &lt;/em&gt;them while an adult’s experience is &lt;em&gt;who they are&lt;/em&gt;.  For the adult, their experience is what makes them unique and makes them who they are; it is an important part of their identity and self-concept. Children, on the other hand, develop their self- identity in reliance on external factors such as family, community, school, and church.  This changes over time as the children matures and starts to identify themselves based on their experiences.

Check out John Henschke of Lindenwood University’s website at &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lindenwood.edu/education/andragogy&quot;&gt;www.lindenwood.edu/education/andragogy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; and German professor Jost Reischmann’s website at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.andragogy.net&quot;&gt;www.andragogy.net&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;In particular, explore...or pay attention to...or look at...(can we have more direction here?)&lt;/strong&gt;

…

###Learning Activity 1

While reading Brookfield chapter 4, consider how self-directed learning is at the heard &lt;strong&gt;(heart?) &lt;/strong&gt;of adult education. &lt;strong&gt;(could we have 1-2 more questions?  or some application or questions of students&#039; experience?  E.g. Think about the last time you took at test. What strategies did you use? Where did you learn these strategies and what motivated you to use them?  or something like that leading students to consider their ownership of learning - or whatever chapter 4 is about!:)&lt;/strong&gt;

Topic 3: Prior Needs Assessment

###Introduction

Before you plan to teach anything it’s a good idea to find out what your students already know.  You can save time (and boredom) by not spending time on topics or skills that they already know and instead plan to enhance their knowledge and take them further.  This is a much more motivating approach and one that adults will appreciate.  A prior needs assessment is not always a ‘quiz’ though – it can be a discussion, a concept map, a KWL (Know, Want to Know, Learned), a ‘Minute Paper’….. The idea is to plan a way to learn what the participants already know on the topic. Because they are adults it’s important to recognize their prior life experience. Remember Knowles’ second principle of andragogy as cited in Merriam and Bierema (2014): &lt;em&gt;An adult accumulates a growing reservoir of experience, which is a rich resource for learning.  &lt;/em&gt;This is the essential reason for prior learning assessment.
