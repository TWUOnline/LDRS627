<h2>Overview</h2>

Teachers have power!  Students have power!  The dynamic interplay between these in a learning environment can create a positive, safe and authentic experience<strong>,</strong> or one wrought with tension, confusion and ‘second guessing’.  Part of preparing to be an adult educator is being aware of your power as well as the power among students<strong>,</strong> and between students and you. Why is it necessary to know about this?  Because adults (and that includes both the educator and the participants) have a lifetime of experiences, ideas, prejudices, misinformation, biases, and brilliance that they bring to the learning environment and these all impact learning.

Consider for example how the topic of <em>Women in Leadership</em> might be received by various individuals: a woman from the Global South, a man from the Global South, a pastor, a millennial, a woman who has worked from home/not in the paid workforce, a business person, a health care provider….  There are so many possible receptions to this topic!  Navigating the varied possible receptions of any topic when you are planning requires consideration of power dynamics and participants’ realities as far as you know about them.  It takes personal research or self-directed learning and if done well, can lead to transformative experiences for both you and your participants.  I live a profound and genuine joy when I am learning with my students. This is how I know deeply that teaching is my vocation.

Let me give you an example of power, self-directed learning and transformation that I experienced a few years ago.  At the time I was a newly hired faculty member for Trinity Western University and was excited to be invited to speak at an International Leadership Conference on the topic of Women in Leadership.  Imagine the challenge before me:  a Western woman, all-girls’ school in Chennai, India<strong>,</strong> where violence against women is rampant, among faculty who were feisty nuns<strong> </strong> intent on equipping ‘their girls’ to change India and make it more equitable and fair for women, their families and future generations.  I embraced the challenge as a personal self-directed learning endeavor, did as much research on the lived reality about who I imagined my participants at the conference to be, and planned to share my story and the research describing women in leadership over the past forty years. A major consideration was social justice and the role of women as change agents.  I decided to take my then sixteen year old daughter with me for this amazing experience.  Having her there also influenced our reception in positive ways -  (power dynamics at play)!  Thankfully, the presentation was well received and my daughter and I learned so much from the research, enjoyed the kind hospitality of our hosts at the College and were astounded that approximately four hundred participants (mostly women) came to listen!  Preparing for the conference and taking that trip taught us about power dynamics, the value of self-directed learning and impacted our worldview.  Post-conference anecdotal feedback received from faculty at the college revealed that the participants too learned about power dynamics and the possibilities of critical transformation in their own lives and the society they hoped to influence.

You will explore these topics of power, critical transformational learning and prior learning assessment in this unit.

<h3><strong>Learning Cafe </strong></h3>

Before you continue with Unit 2, take a couple minutes to connect with other learners in the <em>Learning Cafe</em>.  You were introduced to this cafe in Unit 1 and shared a little about yourself.  This week, use the following prompt to get a new conversation going:  <em>What is the best advice you’ve ever received?</em>

&nbsp;

<h3>Topics</h3>

Unit 2 is divided into 3 topics:
Topic 1: Critical and Transformative Learning
Topic 2: Pedagogy and Andragogy
Topic 3: Prior needs assessment

&nbsp;

<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>

When you have completed this unit you should be able to:

<ul>
    <li>Define critical transformational learning and its elements in your own words.</li>
    <li>Describe two or three methods used to empower people for quality improvement. <strong>[where is this discussed in the unit?]</strong></li>
    <li>Explain the difference between pedagogy and andragogy.</li>
    <li>Collect data to inform instructional decisions and planning.</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;

<h3>Activity Checklist</h3>

Here is a checklist of learning activities you will benefit from in completing this unit. You may find it useful for planning your work.

<ol>
    <li>Read the unit overview and topic notes.</li>
    <li>Read Brookfield Chapter 1.</li>
    <li>Write a blog post on critical transformational learning.</li>
    <li>Read Brookfield chapter 4.</li>
    <li>Read Wang chapter 10</li>
    <li>Read Sandlin, J., Redmon Wright R., Clark C. (2013). Reexamining Theories of Adult Learning and Adult Development through the Lenses of Public Pedagogy. <em>Adult Education Quarterly</em> 63:3, 14-16. <strong>(Adrienne, when do students read this?  I put it in topic 3)  It fits best in topic 1 actually.</strong></li>
    <li>Thinking about your specific organization, take the department team building questionnaire Silberman p. 375 figure 18.4.</li>
    <li>Write a blog post on next steps for quality improvement.</li>
    <li>Complete the <strong>Reading Response Assignment,</strong> worth 10% of your course grade.</li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

Go to Topics to continue with Unit 2.

<h2>Checking your Learning</h2>

Use the learning outcomes for this unit as a checklist of understanding before moving on to the next unit.

<ul>
    <li>Can your define critical transformational learning and its elements in your own words?</li>
    <li>Can you describe two or three methods used to empower people for quality improvement?</li>
    <li>Can you explain the difference between pedagogy and andragogy?</li>
    <li>Are you able to collect data to inform instructional decisions and planning?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assessment (new page)</h2>

<h5>Assignment: Reading response 10%</h5>

Based on the assigned reading for this unit, you are encouraged to carefully read and think about the course material in order to answer the following key questions:

Sandlin article

<ol>
    <li>Do you agree that public pedagogy reproduces hegemonic practices?  Why/why not?  Give examples.</li>
    <li>Define transformative education in your own words. How is identity foundational to transformative adult education?</li>
    <li>How does relational learning figure into critical transformational learning? Give an example from your context.</li>
</ol>

Silberman text

<ol>
    <li>What is the difference between covering material and discovering material? Explain how the methods differ in each approach and why the distinction is significant.</li>
    <li>Comment on this quote from Eric Jensen, author of <em>Brain Based Learning</em> cited in Silberman p. 5 “The traditional stand and delivery approach is antagonistic. The brain is not very god at absorbing countless bits of semantic (factual) information”.</li>
</ol>

Brookfield text

<ol>
    <li>What are three connotations of power? Why is this information helpful to you as an adult educator?</li>
    <li>What is Brookfield’s simple definition of what teaching is. Comment on the significance of it.</li>
    <li>What four methods make teaching adults distinctive?</li>
    <li>Based on Brookfield’s definition (ch. 4 pgs 90-95), describe a self-directed learning project you have done and how it made a difference to your self-confidence and understanding of yourself.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Reading Response Rubric  </strong>

<strong>KELLY THIS IS THE SAME RUBRIC FOR EACH BIWEEKLY ASSIGNMENT - I SUGGEST WE HAVE IT IN UNIT 2 AND THEN IN WEEKS 4, 6, 8 AND 10 LINK TO THE RUBRIC TO AVOID REPETITION  I have updated the rubric as per email Wed/Thurs.</strong>
