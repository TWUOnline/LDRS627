<h2>Topic 3: <strong>Experiential learning</strong></h2>
As it relates to <a href="https://learn.twu.ca/mod/url/view.php?id=36739" rel="nofollow">chaos theory</a> and helping people to find the right fit for a job, Dr. Jim Bright asks the question, “What are we doing to prepare people for uncertainty” (Bright, 2013)? Bright makes numerous suggestions, a couple of which include networking and pursuing creativity as they navigate their search (Bright, 2013). Predictable fill-in-the-blank answers can seem unreliable and less helpful in uncertain times. Falling along a similar theme, Brookfield pushes educators to look beyond the predicable and measurable in his chapter on <em>Negotiating the Emotions of Powerful Teaching</em>. Referring to questions of pedagogical mechanics Brookfield states, “All these are obviously important questions to ask, but they focus on the outside of teaching as against our inner lives” (Brookfield, 2013, p. 217). We need to pay attention to what is happening on the inside. What happens on the inside has a significant impact on our experiences and on the decisions we make and it is a very important part of the learning process.

As a teacher, Jesus seemed to be more interested in the transformation of a person than their ability to digest content. Jesus provoked discussion. He asked more questions than he answered. Jesus was not afraid to stir things up. He seemed to be okay with <a href="https://learn.twu.ca/mod/resource/view.php?id=36737" rel="nofollow">change</a>, chance, complexity, and uncertainty. Jesus came with a message of <a href="https://learn.twu.ca/mod/resource/view.php?id=36737" rel="nofollow">change</a>, and he consistently left people feeling uncertain about the often flimsy realities they had created for themselves. Jesus constantly challenged people to probe deeper, ask more questions, and wrestle with their motivations. It seems that Jesus was quite intentional when it came to preparing people for uncertainty.

Through a more experiential approach to learning people have the potential to feel more ownership over their experience. Helping the learner to shift from a passive to a more active mode of learning is important for the learner to see how their story connects to the subject at hand. If as educators we are only dispensing knowledge, we may actually limit the growth and development of our learners.  Ultimately it is not about our knowledge but about their transformation.

The following questionnaire is an activity you will complete this week and also in week 6.  As a teacher of adult students, it's important to...<strong>[Adrienne, can we explain a bit more of why you included this?  It's a great technique for students to use in their own classes]</strong>

 	<li>Submit the questionnaire to Dropbox CIQ <strong>[we'll insert submission instructions later]</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong>Kelly here is the survey - it's good to ask students to complete in weeks 3 and 6 so that adjustments can be made as necessary.  I would have added it to unit 6 but it's not a page yet.  Please help me remember to add it into unit 6. [okay:)]</strong>

<strong>The Classroom Critical Incident Questionnaire</strong>

Please take about ten minutes to respond to the questions below.  If nothing comes to mind for any of the questions just leave the space blank. Thanks for taking the time to do this.  What you write will help me make the class more responsive to your concerns.
<ol>
 	<li>At what moment in class these few weeks did you feel most engaged with what was happening?</li>
 	<li>At what moment in class these few weeks were you most distanced from what was happening?</li>
 	<li>What action that anyone (teacher or student) took these few weeks did you find most affirming or helpful?</li>
 	<li>What action that anyone took these few weeks did you find most puzzling or confusing?</li>
 	<li>What about the class so far surprised you the most? (This could be about your own reactions to what went on, something that someone did, or anything else that occurs).</li>

In this unit, you have had the opportunity to learn about the impact of emotions on learning. Hopefully this learning has given you 'permission' to expand the repertoire of teaching methods you draw on so as to elicit an emotional connection between your learners and what you are trying to teach.
