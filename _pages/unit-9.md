Unit 9: The Nuts and Bolts: Strategies for Engaging Teaching and Learning
<h1>Overview</h1>
You may be surprised that this unit is so late in the class – but it is by design!  Planning the ‘how’ of learning opportunities necessarily comes after determining learning objectives and assessment.  This is sometimes referred to as ‘Backwards Planning’. (For more on this approach see this <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/edvainker/backwards-planning">Slideshare presentation</a> and/or this <a href="https://www.ascd.org/ASCD/pdf/books/mctighe2004_intro.pdf">article</a> by one of the ‘gurus’ Jay McTighe.)  In this unit you will focus on how to create opening exercises and designing active and engaging learning opportunities.
