<!--themify_builder_static--><p>Welcome to Leadership 627!Â  In this first unit you will explore reflective practice and teaching perspectives, critical and transformative learning, and roles and factors impacting adult educators.</p><p>It&#8217;s important for educators to be reflective about their practice and to keep the learning outcomes about the students. This is what is referred to as student-centered learning. Always remember that you are teaching people &#8211; not x, y, z subject. If you keep this focus, you will be more attracted to choosing methods that will facilitate critical thinking and this will potentially lead to transformations in the perspectives and lives of your learners. Adult educators are impacted by various societal factors because adult education happens in the world! The key is helping participants analyze their experience critically and figure out how what they are learning &#8216;fits&#8217; or challenges their lived experience.</p>
