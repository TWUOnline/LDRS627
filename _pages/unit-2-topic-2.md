<h2>Assignment 2: Blog post</h2>

<h3>Part A</h3>

Write 300 words (approximately) on the following:

a) Define critical transformational learning in your own words.

b) How can you as an adult education foster critical transformative learning in your context?

<strong>[Is this an ungraded or optional activity, or a part of the assignment for this unit?  We need to specify, especially as there is a blog post with 9 questions at the bottom of the unit.  I assume they'll get one grade for all 11 questions?]  Blog posts in LDRS 627 account for 20% in all so it's a graded activity.  The Reading/Viewing Response assignments account for 50% overall.</strong>

&nbsp;

<h3><strong>Part B?  (from </strong>Learning Activity 1)</h3>

<strong>[Are any of these questions to be answered in their blog?]</strong>

While reading Brookfield chapter 4, consider how self-directed learning is at the heart<strong> </strong>of adult education.

What is the difference between self-paced learning and self-directed learning?
How does self-directed learning relate to power?
What is the value of a learning audit in self-directed learning?

&nbsp;

<h3>Part C?</h3>

<strong>[Optional activity questions or part of the Blog Assignment?]</strong>

<h3></h3>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking about your specific organization, take the department team building questionnaire Silberman p. 375 figure 18.4. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Identify two or three </span><a href="https://learn.twu.ca/mod/url/view.php?id=36727"><span style="font-weight: 400;">next steps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regarding how you can intervene for quality improvement.  <strong>(do we need this hyperlink to the next steps video? If so, let's remind students of the video they watched in Unit 1.)  Yes I think it helps.</strong></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">*State your plan to the C-Suite following the guidelines described on p. 387 and 388.</span>

&nbsp;

After you have finished your blog post, be sure to respond substantively to at least two other classmates' blogs.

<h2>Assessment (new page)</h2>

<h5>Assignment: Reading response 10%</h5>

Based on the assigned reading for this unit, you are encouraged to carefully read and think about the course material in order to answer the following key questions:

Sandlin article

<ol>
    <li>Do you agree that public pedagogy reproduces hegemonic practices?  Why/why not?  Give examples.</li>
    <li>Define transformative education in your own words. How is identity foundational to transformative adult education?</li>
    <li>How does relational learning figure into critical transformational learning? Give an example from your context.</li>
</ol>

Silberman text

<ol>
    <li>What is the difference between covering material and discovering material? Explain how the methods differ in each approach and why the distinction is significant.</li>
    <li>Comment on this quote from Eric Jensen, author of <em>Brain Based Learning</em> cited in Silberman p. 5 “The traditional stand and delivery approach is antagonistic. The brain is not very god at absorbing countless bits of semantic (factual) information”.</li>
</ol>

Brookfield text

<ol>
    <li>What are three connotations of power? Why is this information helpful to you as an adult educator?</li>
    <li>What is Brookfield’s simple definition of what teaching is. Comment on the significance of it.</li>
    <li>What four methods make teaching adults distinctive?</li>
    <li>Based on Brookfield’s definition (ch. 4 pgs 90-95), describe a self-directed learning project you have done and how it made a difference to your self-confidence and understanding of yourself.</li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

<h3>Grading Criteria</h3>

The following rubric will be used to assess your blog and responses in this unit.

<strong>KELLY THIS IS THE SAME RUBRIC FOR EACH BIWEEKLY ASSIGNMENT - I SUGGEST WE HAVE IT IN UNIT 2 AND THEN IN WEEKS 4, 6, 8 AND 10 LINK TO THE RUBRIC TO AVOID REPETITION  I have updated the rubric as per email Wed/Thurs.</strong>
