<h2><strong>Topic 1: Assessment Techniques</strong></h2>
<strong> </strong>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
As mentioned in the introduction to the unit, assessment can be summative or formative.  Examples of summative assessment tools that you might choose to use in the adult learning setting include quizzes, assignments involving questions and answers, presentations or projects.  These are summative when they are evaluated and a grade assigned.  If however they are used so that feedback can be given and student can continue to develop their understanding and demonstrate growth, they become formative assessments.  Formative assessment is more about learning than scoring achievement.  When planning, try to include more formative assessments and fewer summative assessments.  The ratio, in my opinion, should be 70-80% formative assessments and 20-30% summative assessments - but this is only a guideline!  The goal is always creating an environment conducive to student learning.

What does formative assessment look like in an adult education setting?
<ul>
 	<li>Instructors frequently pause for questions or informally collect information during instruction.</li>
 	<li>There is collaboration between the instructor and the learner.</li>
 	<li>Feedback system is learner-centered and specific.</li>
 	<li>Meta-cognitive strategies are favoured so that learners can tell when a strategy is not working and plan new approaches.</li>
 	<li>Scoring rubrics are used so that expectations are transparent and learners understand how to improve.</li>
 	<li>A lot of questions are asked and the "Big Question" (read: Essential, Global, Enduring) approach for lesson design is frequently followed</li>
 	<li>Respect is promoted as is a climate free from embarrassment.</li>
 	<li>Risk-taking and the freedom to make mistakes are promoted.</li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>

<strong>Critical Thinking in Assessment</strong>

Consider the <a href="https://www.criticalthinking.org/ctmodel/logic-model1.htm">elements of critical thinking</a> introduced last unit as you design your assessment. Incorporating the elements of critical thinking is an excellent way to promote higher order thinking and learning.  Here are some examples of how to use the elements of critical thinking when designing assessment:
<ul>
 	<li>Ask good questions – take your specific objectives for the lesson and create questions using the elements as prompts.</li>
 	<li>Group discussion – give students the elements and ask them to use them to analyze a reading or video.</li>
 	<li>Teach how to come up with a thesis statement using the elements.  Take the topic and go around the circle asking each participant to create a statement from one of the prompts associated with the elements.  At the end, you will end up with as many statements as there are participants.  Help students work with the statements, combining them, etc. to make their thesis statement. This process facilitates sharp thinking and helps to focus students.</li>
 	<li>Use the elements as an outline to help students writing in a more disciplined way about a topic.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Activity 6.1: Reading about assessment principles</h3>
Read Lindstrom, G., Taylor, L &amp; Weleschuk, A. (2017). <a href="http://studentassessment.ucalgaryblogs.ca/files/2017/06/Guiding-Principles-for-Assessment-of-Student-Learning-FINAL.pdf"><em>Guiding Principles for Assessment</em></a>.  University of Calgary Taylor Institute for Teaching and Learning.

&nbsp;

As you read this, pay particular attention to the sections: Enhancing teaching and learning culture and Enhancing formative assessment.  Take down some notes that you want to follow up on in your own practice and with your learning design assignment for this course.

&nbsp;
<h3>Activity 6.2: Reading about assessment strategies</h3>
Read Silberman chapters 15 and 17 and review <a href="https://vcsa.ucsd.edu/_files/assessment/resources/50_cats.pdf">50 CATS by Angelo and Cross: Techniques for Assessing Course-Related Knowledge and Skills</a>

&nbsp;

Which activities would be good for your adult learning design assignment? Be sure to take note of assessment strategies you may want to use in the future as you teach or train others. These may also help you in your assessments in other courses.

<h3>Activity 6.3: Blog Post Assignment</h3>
Blog Post:  Referring to Lindstrom, Taylor &amp; Weleschuk, Silberman and Angelo and Cross as appropriate, how can assessment for learning enhance critical thinking in adult education?
<h2><strong>
Topic 2: Barriers to Adult Learning </strong></h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
There are barriers to adult learning that you should keep in mind as you plan your learning opportunities and assessment.  There may be undiagnosed learning disabilities, cross cultural differences and English language learning to be considered.  MA Lead alum (2017) Jane Rukshana Ali addressed barriers to adult learning in her Leadership Integration Project.  The following are notes from her research, used with permission.

<u>Learning Disabilities</u>
<ul>
 	<li>Adults with learning disabilities may not recognize their challenges in learning if they were not identified earlier.</li>
 	<li>Learning Disabilities refer to a number of disorders which may affect the acquisition, organization, retention, understanding or use of verbal or nonverbal information. (LDAC, 2015)</li>
 	<li>Learning disabilities necessitate a lifelong process of empowering learning with support.</li>
</ul>
<strong><em>Strategies for Assessment</em></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>In the classroom, an educator’s role is to identify the needs of the students. They need to advocate for their learning with clear understanding of what the challenges are.</li>
 	<li>Refer students to the <a href="https://www.twu.ca/wellness-centre/disabilities-and-equity-access/steps-attaining-disability-services">Steps to attaining disability services at TWU</a></li>
 	<li>See the following resources for further advice on assisting students with different abilities:
<ul>
 	<li>University of Manitoba Handbook for Faculty: <a href="http://umanitoba.ca/student/saa/accessibility/media/SAS-Handbook.pdf">http://umanitoba.ca/student/saa/accessibility/media/SAS-Handbook.pdf</a>- (see especially pages 12, 14-38</li>
 	<li>Cheatsheets for creating accessible materials, such as Word or PowerPoint presentations: <a href="http://ncdae.org/resources/cheatsheets/">http://ncdae.org/resources/cheatsheets/</a></li>
 	<li>Dalhousie list for how advisors help students: <a href="https://www.dal.ca/campus_life/academic-support/accessibility.html">https://www.dal.ca/campus_life/academic-support/accessibility.html</a></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<strong> </strong>

&nbsp;
<h3><u>Culture</u></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>There are many aspects of culture which may impact an adult learner, including family, work, community, and faith.</li>
 	<li>Faith, for example, can be a barrier when a religious group does not allow certain groups members to have an education (e.g., in certain sects of the Islamic faith governed by Sharia law, women are not given the opportunity to educate themselves.)</li>
 	<li>Family and work also impact adult learners. Students often feel stressed and are busy or tired at work as a result of attending school (Kirby et al, 2004, p. 73).</li>
</ul>
<strong><em>Strategies for Assessment</em></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>For many adults, theory is better explained with stories in context from educators and learners. “Teachers of adults keep in mind the importance, wherever possible, of using learners’ prior experiences to create connections to the new material being studied or the new skill sets being developed” (Brookfield, 2013, p. 19).</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h4><u>English Language Learning</u></h4>
<ul>
 	<li>There are many adult learners with insufficient proficiency in English including native and non-native speakers.</li>
 	<li><em>English Language Learning (ELL)</em> is defined as the teaching of English to people who speak a different language and who, presently, live in a country where English is the main language spoken. However, <em>ELL</em> learners may speak the English language well but may lack the academic nuances in writing and reading skills.</li>
 	<li>Native English speakers may also struggle with academic English: [for] “non-traditional students who are returning to school after long periods of being out of the academic mode, skills needed for academic survival must be reviewed and polished” (Caron, 1994, p. 11).</li>
</ul>
<strong><em>Strategies for Assessment</em></strong>
<ul>
 	<li>For these students, lessons need to be restructured to allow for the decoding of sentences and words.</li>
 	<li>Time should be given to redefine the words that have no meaning to their knowledge of English.</li>
 	<li>An educator’s role is to make learning easier by structuring the content and implementing strategies that are achievable and will assist the adult learner in overcoming their challenges in learning.</li>
 	<li>Refer students to the <a href="https://www.twu.ca/student-life/student-success/writing-centre">TWU Writing Centre</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Activity 6.4: Reading</h3>
Read Wang, C.X. (2017). Theory and Practice of Adult and Higher Education. Chapter 4.

You may have read this for unit 4 but refresh your memory by going over your notes. Focus on the barriers to adult learning and how these impact assessment.
