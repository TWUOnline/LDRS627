<h1>Topic 1: Creating opening exercises</h1>
<strong> </strong>

You may know of Malcolm Gladwell’s research about the power of first impressions. It’s worth reading more about (<a href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/why-blink-matters-the-power-of-first-impressions-1919374">here</a> is a brief summary). Gladwell discusses our snap judgments of people and situations, and this information has implications for adult educators. When we’re planning sessions, we need to pay particular attention to our opening exercises so that participants’ first impressions are favourable, and they are willing to commit to being involved and engaged in whatever we have planned.

&nbsp;

Opening exercises (also referred to as warm-ups or icebreakers) should be tied to the data collected from pre-assessments and to the objectives of the session. It’s important to find ways to connect the learners’ experience to what you are going to be teaching.  This will answer the unspoken question in participants’ minds: <em>Is this going to be worth my time? </em>Opening exercises should also help people feel connected in some way and establish some group sense of purpose.

&nbsp;

Silberman chapter 3 has many practical strategies for team building, on the spot assessment and immediate learning involvement.  As you read you will learn about the following methods: Open discussion, response cards, polling, subgroup discussions, partners, go-arounds, games, calling on the next speaker, panels and fishbowls.  Wang chapter 13 synthesizes research about opening exercises, considers learning resistance and practical strategies.   Here is a taste of the findings that are unpacked in more detail in chapter 13:

&nbsp;

Most of the literature indicates that teachers will see the most success with students if they focus on creating a positive first impression by exhibiting positive body language and using nonverbal cues to draw students’ attention…. Appear confident and professional, …. High amounts of eye contact, …. Creating a good learning atmosphere, ….ice breakers… professional and organized. (332-333)

&nbsp;

Frye, S., Taylor, J. &amp; Stafford, A. in Wang emphasize the importance of passion – believing in the importance of what you teach and the influence you have as an educator to help people become the best version of themselves.  Their words about passion are quite poetic:

&nbsp;

Passion is not passive; passion leans forward with its face in the wind. Passion is passed through to practice in the form of energy and motion. Passion is not monotone; passion is not motionless. Passion does not stand behind a lectern or sit in a chair. In fact, passion doesn’t stand still much at all. (340)

&nbsp;

One way of planning to communicate your passion is to create an ‘elevator speech’ about your course or learning session.  Introduce the topic, give one or two ‘did you know ‘statements (surprising facts), ask your participants to imagine a preferred future and ‘sell’ the course as a step to creating this preferred future. Then make it interactive and ask for their ideas.  Here is a TedTalk <a href="https://youtu.be/Xlg8zdSVjgg">video</a> about how to communicate your passion and create intrigue in a structured and intentional way.  I tried it at an important meeting recently and it worked marvelously!

<strong> </strong>
<h2>Activity 9.1: Reading</h2>
Read the following chapters:
<ul>
 	<li>Silberman, M. L., &amp; Biech, E. (2015). <em>Active training: A handbook of techniques, designs, case examples, and tips (4th ed.).</em> Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons Chapter 3 and 11</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li>Wang, C. X. (2017). <em>Theory and Practice of Adult and Higher Education</em>. Information Age Publishing Inc. Chapter 13</li>
</ul>
When reading these chapters, take note of the strategies that most resonate with your preferred style of teaching and what you think would be most effective in your context.  How do you get learners involved and engaged right from the beginning of your session?

&nbsp;
<h2>Activity 9.2: Creating and Elevator Speech</h2>
<strong> </strong>

After watching the TedTalk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xlg8zdSVjgg&amp;feature=youtu.be">video</a> referenced in the introduction to topic 1, create your own ‘elevator speech’ about something you are passionate about.  If you like, post it to the <strong>Learning Café </strong>for this week so that we can all learn a bit more about one another.

<strong> </strong>

<strong> </strong>
<h1>Topic 2: Designing Active Learning Opportunities</h1>
<strong> </strong>

<strong>Introduction</strong>

The heart and soul of teaching well is designing, sequencing and planning active learning opportunities around engaging and compelling content.  This is creative work that requires the educator to research solid content aligned with the learning objectives and discern effective means of sharing and engaging learners with that content. Furthermore, it requires the educator to think about their specific learners, their prior knowledge about the topic, any fears or resistance they may bring to the topic and then carefully craft the time allotted so that objectives can be met in a fair, reasonably-paced, anxiety-free and hopefully enjoyable manner. It is tempting to try to use many fun activities during a session, but it’s very important to be judicious in selecting activities that serve a learning purpose.  Avoid the trap of many beginning educators who focus more on ‘activitizing’ rather than aligning learning opportunities to objectives and assessment.  <strong>     </strong>

There are many chapters to read this week from Silberman. It’s not heavy reading as the book is a handbook, so you’ll find yourself reading quickly through the eclectic mix of ideas, case studies and best practices. It’s very practical reading and I’m sure you’ll find much that is applicable to your work setting and much to reflect upon how to integrate into your current practice. It’s okay to bounce around the text and read what strikes you as relevant. Yes, it’s okay to ‘skim’!

The delivery of a program involves adjusting, refining and redesigning. It’s about fitting the content to the participants – their questions, their needs, their mood even. Some things you can’t define in advance so you have to have a bit of a ‘bag of tricks’ to draw from to suit the situation. This all takes a lot of advance planning. As Silberman says ‘Preparation is one of the most important ingredients for success’ (p. 207).

As you consider how the strategies and technologies presented by Silberman may relate to your context, also consider the bigger picture of education that involves a vision where educators and students alike become agents of transformation. How might you as an educator reflect this vision of faith and hope? How might the strategies and techniques you choose to design your learning opportunities convey this message of hope?
<h2>Activity 9.3 Reading</h2>
Skim these chapters and read what is interesting and useful to your practice and context. Note anything of relevance to your learning design assignment.

Silberman, M. L., &amp; Biech, E. (2015). <em>Active training: A handbook of techniques, designs, case examples, and tips (4th ed.)</em>. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons  (Chaps 7, 8, 9, 10)

<strong> </strong>
<h2>Activity 9.4: Draft Review</h2>
&nbsp;

Look at your draft learning design assignment and ensure that you have included creative design of learning opportunities.  Consider the time allotted, buy-in, key points and instructions, materials, physical setting, sequencing and ending.  Would integrating technology enhance the learning design (See considerations in Silberman pgs 226-227)?

<h1>Topic 3: Leading Discussions and teacher-lead presentations</h1>
<strong> </strong>

<strong>Introduction</strong>

Just for a laugh, view <a href="https://youtu.be/uhiCFdWeQfA">this video</a> about how NOT to present or facilitate discussion. ("Anyone, anyone” teacher from <em>Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</em>)

Discussions don’t happen ‘on the fly’ and it’s not enough to write in your lesson plan ‘have a discussion about…’.  You need to think about how you will involve all learners, how to create a safe environment where agreeing to disagree is possible, how the discussion will proceed to avoid bias, exchange of misinformation or inaccurate facts.  Giving voice to adults in an academic environment relates to Academic Freedom.  You may be interested in <a href="https://www.twu.ca/academic-freedom-trinity-western-university">TWU’s website for Academic Freedom (AF)</a>. There you will find the statement as well as a Discussion paper.

Brookfield explains power differences among students and how these manifest in the class. It can certainly be a challenge for educators to promote participation in as democratic a manner as possible. Adult educators need to emphasize with learners that it’s not about speaking out as often as possible to impress the teacher. On the contrary, the goal is group creation of knowledge through discussion. Brookfield admonishes readers to remember that ‘the most important part of participation is listening, not talking’ and that ‘a good discussion participant is someone who links contributions, asks questions of others, builds on comments, and raises questions’ (p. 71). Several interesting and worthwhile facilitation techniques are described in Brookfield’s chapter 3, and in depth in his book: Brookfield, Stephen and Preskill, S. (2016). <em>The Discussion Book: 50 Great Ways to Get People Talking</em>. San Francisco: Jossey Bass.

‘Preparation is one of the most important ingredients for success’ (Silberman, p. 207). Keep in mind his advice that planning is not (only) about you – it’s about the participants! He suggests that the first time you present content – use the expertise of the group; keep track of questions on a ‘Parking Lot’. When you’ve given a session many times, it’s important to keep your enthusiasm, be flexible, change it up (be creative!), establish rapport with participants and learn from others.

Facilitating discussion is a key skill of the adult educator and giving voice to the adult learner is one of the most important aspects for an adult educator to consider. Getting learners involved in the topic and having the confidence to speak in class and share their ideas whether through discussions or presentations, are essential elements of adult education. If you are strategic about planning discussion, your learners will be more involved and perceive you to be fair.  Your effectiveness as an adult educator will be greatly enhanced.
<h2>Activity 9.5: Reading</h2>
Read Silberman, M. L., &amp; Biech, E. (2015). Active training: A handbook of techniques, designs, case examples, and tips (4th ed.). Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons (Chap 13)

&nbsp;

Read Brookfield, S. (2013). <em>Powerful techniques for teaching adults</em>. (Chap 3)

&nbsp;

Skim read Brookfield, Stephen and Preskill, S. (2016). <em>The Discussion Book: 50 Great Ways to Get People Talking.</em> San Francisco: Jossey Bass

This is a very accessible manual that collects the best techniques to start discussion, keep it going and stay focused. Depending on what your role and context are, you will choose techniques accordingly.  The book doesn’t have traditional chapters per se but a listing of fifty techniques fully explained.  Check out the user guide on pages xiii-xvii to help you choose techniques for your situation.

<strong> </strong>
<h2>Activity 9.6: Blog post, graded</h2>
In the Brookfield <a href="http://youtu.be/Y8umk4w8kB8%20%20Critical%20Thinking">video</a> you viewed in week 5 and considering this week's reading, how do Brookfield and Silberman advise instructors to challenge student assumptions and model the exploration of alternative perspectives?

<strong> </strong>
<h2>Activity 9.7: Peer Review</h2>
Post a draft your Adult Lesson Design assignment for peer review .

Respond to your assigned colleague’s draft adult lesson design

Peer review pairing will be given in advance.

Your peer review should be collegial and address issues like grammar and structure as well as the quality of arguments and evidence presented in the paper. Use the rubric as a guide and give suggestions accordingly.

Please remember!
<ul>
 	<li>Be Kind: Always treat others with dignity and respect. This means we never use words that are hurtful, including sarcasm.</li>
 	<li>Be Specific: Focus on particular strengths and weaknesses, rather than making general comments like “It’s good” or “I like it.” Provide insight into why it is good or what, specifically, you like about it.</li>
 	<li>Be Helpful: The goal is to positively contribute to the individual or the group, not to simply be heard. Echoing the thoughts of others or cleverly pointing out details that are irrelevant wastes time.</li>
 	<li>Participate: Peer critique is a process to support each other, and your feedback is valued!</li>
 	<li>When critiquing a peer’s work, use “I” statements. For example, “I’m confused by this part,” rather than “This part makes no sense.”</li>
 	<li>Use questions whenever possible. For example, “I’m curious why you chose to begin with…?”, or “Did you consider adding…?”</li>
</ul>
Remember the three important phrases:

“I notice….”

“I wonder….”
