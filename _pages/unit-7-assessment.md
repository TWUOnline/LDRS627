<h1>Adult Learning Design Assignment</h1>

During this Reading Week, you are encouraged to start your Adult Learning Design Assignment.  This will be due at the end of the course, but a draft must be ready for an extensive Peer Review in Week 7. For this assignment you will design a lesson, 3-6 hours in length, incorporating all of the principles and strategies learned in this course.

Read the following criteria below, as well as the grading rubric.

&nbsp;

<strong><u>Institutional Context </u></strong>

<ul>
    <li>Identify the location of the proposed adult learning session so that contextual factors that inform the design are clear.</li>
    <li>Explain the purpose or reason that the learning is needed and identify the problem that the training seeks to remedy.</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;

<strong><u>Problem Identification</u></strong>

<ul>
    <li>Give a detailed profile of the learners or participants in the training. This should be in enough depth that that those reading the lesson plan can discern whether it would meet needs of learners in another context.</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;

<strong><u>Learning Outcomes/Goals and Objectives </u></strong>

<ul>
    <li>Write clear learning outcomes, goals and objectives. Follow the A,B,C,D format for all goals. Goals and objectives should show clear alignment with principles of andragogy.</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;

<strong><u>Integration of Transformational Servant Leadership and Values Based Leadership</u></strong>

<ul>
    <li>Incorporate TSL and VBL in every activity in the learning design.</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;

<strong><u>Learning Activities </u></strong>

<ul>
    <li>The activities should be clearly informed by principles of andragogy, and described well so that anyone could facilitate them.</li>
    <li>The sequence of activities should make sense and the timeline should be clearly outlined for each activity and steps of activity (3-6 hours in length).</li>
    <li>Be sure to organize the activity information well and have a clear and consistent format.</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;

<strong><u>Format, Mechanics of writing </u></strong>

<ul>

    <li>Follow the APA formatting protocols for writing and referencing.</li>
    <li>Prepare and include all handouts, ppts and other materials in the Learning Design so that it is ready to be facilitated.</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;

<strong><u>Assessment </u></strong>

<ul>
    <li>Clearly describe your system for collecting information about students’ abilities, characteristics, skills, understanding and knowledge; less emphasis on summative testing and more emphasis on formative assessment; gathering data while teaching and learning are occurring.</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;

<strong><u>Peer Review Comments by classmate  </u></strong>

<ul>
    <li>Address feedback as appropriate/according to rubric and show how you would use feedback to improve the Lesson Design.</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;

<strong><u>Your Peer Review of someone else’s Lesson Design</u></strong>

<ul>
    <li>Show evidence in your comments of comparing your draft to the rubric criteria – provide in depth comments and suggestions.</li>
    <li>Be hard on content, soft on people. Show evidence of challenging peers to think beyond or differently about some aspect of their submission. Kind, specific, helpful comments refer to specific sections and avoid generalizations. There should be no errors in grammar or composition.</li>
</ul>
