Critical thinking is helpfully <a href="http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/critical-thinking-basic-questions-amp-answers/409">defined by Richard Paul (1992)</a> as:  ‘<em>thinking about your thinking while you’re thinking in order to make your thinking better.  Two things are crucial: </em><em>1)</em><em> critical thinking is not just thinking, but thinking which entails self-improvement and 2) this improvement comes from skill in using standards by which one appropriately assesses thinking. To put it briefly, it is self-improvement (in thinking) through standards (that assess thinking).</em>

In this unit you will explore the significance of critical thinking in graduate studies, in adult learning and in life.  With this foundational understanding of why it matters, you will then explore techniques for fostering critical thinking as an adult educator.

<strong> </strong>

<h1>Activity Checklist</h1>

Here is a checklist of learning activities you will benefit from in completing this unit. You may find it useful for planning your work.

<ol>
    <li>Go the <a href="http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/college-and-university-students/799">Foundation of Critical Thinking website</a> and read 3-4 selected articles</li>
    <li>Read the article: <a href="http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/developing-as-rational-persons-viewing-our-development-in-stages/518">Develop as Rational Persons: Viewing our development in stages</a></li>
</ol>

and determine which stage you are at in your rational development.

<ol start="3">
    <li>Read Brookfield, S. (2013). <em>Powerful techniques for teaching adults</em>. Chapter 2</li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

<strong> </strong>

<ol start="4">
    <li>View a <a href="http://youtu.be/Y8umk4w8kB8%20%20Critical%20Thinking">video</a> of Brookfield giving a one hour lecture on critical thinking.</li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

<ol start="5">
    <li>Watch two short videos about critical thinking in life and work contexts:
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/2yEZHXgQKsM">video</a> of author, professional speaker and entrepreneur Mark Sanborn</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTWc-JLh3Fw&amp;feature=youtu.be">Video</a> of author, professional speaker, executive coach and consultant Mark Sikora</li>
    <li>Read Wang, C. X. (2017). <em>Theory and Practice of Adult and Higher Education</em>. Information Age Publishing Inc. Chapters 5, 17</li>
    <li>Read Silberman &amp; Biech (2015) chapters 11-15 and answer the focus questions listed in the activity.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

<ol start="8">
    <li>Assessment: Write a Blog Post: Consider Brookfield and Silberman and discuss how you can build adult education learning experiences that would assist participants to think deeply through a question, issue or problem. Keeping in mind Wang’s assertion that learning “is not merely influenced by social context… but shaped by the extent of participant engagement in practice” (p. 120), be more practical than theoretical in your response; include illustrative examples.</li>
</ol>
