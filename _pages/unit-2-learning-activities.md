<h2>Topic 1: Critical Transformative Learning</h2>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

Transformative learning is learning that causes you to change somehow.  It is using critical thinking to consider if perspectives and assumptions are accurate.  With respect to transformative learning, instructors need to:

<ol>
    <li>Foster transformative learning through critical reflection; use non-rational media such as storytelling, embodied knowing, intuitive and affective, emotional, and spiritual experiences. Other non-rational tools are music, poetry, art, photography, literature, dreams, drama, fiction</li>
    <li>Engage in/encourage dialogue or discourse and social interaction</li>
    <li>Create a space that is open and welcoming to this type of learning: safe, open, and supportive.<strong> </strong></li>
</ol>

Transformative learning is not an individual process but rather a personal process that is carried out in ‘integrally webbed totalities’  <strong>(</strong>O’Sullivan: 2003, 337, cited on page 328 of <em>Contemporary Issues)<strong>(do you need all of this citation, or can we move some info to the Resources/References section?)</strong></em>.   <strong>Maybe just O'Sullivan, 2003 and the rest in the resources/references section.</strong> O’Sullivan believes we are part of a bigger picture.  As I sit here and type this, every decision I made that got me here had an impact on someone else.  As a result of this course or program, you may change the way you make decisions which in turn, affects all of the people in this web differently than they may have been impacted had you made the same decision today.

For learning to be transformative and effective it needs to be job-embedded, ongoing and with built-in follow-up and support. As was evidenced in the Hui, Snider, and Couture (2016) study, the most effective type of professional development for lasting change in a classroom is not a one-time workshop. Traditional stand-and-deliver professional development was conducted by Leblanc, Richardson, and Burns (2009) with minimal results. Effective professional development is instead an ongoing supportive relationship with in-class follow up and teacher choice and input as to the direction of needed development choice (Hui, Snider, Couture, 2016; Katz, 2013; Katz, 2014). Sokal and Sharma (2014) describe an ideal program as entailing between 30 and 100 hours of training hours spread over a span of six to 12 months, with in-house professional learning communities (PLCs) and coursework as part of the training.

So transformative learning is about change.  It's not easy, can be disorienting, involves the hard work of critical thinking and consistent, sustained attention.

<h3>Learning Activity 2.1: Reading</h3>

Read Brookfield Chapter 1. While reading, consider especially how context constantly alters how a practice is put into effect.  Teaching is helping learning.

<h3>Learning Activity 2: Blog post</h3>

Write 300 words (approximately) on the following:

a) Define critical transformational learning in your own words.

b) How can you as an adult education foster critical transformative learning in your context?

<strong>[Is this an ungraded or optional activity, or a part of the assignment for this unit?  We need to specify, especially as there is a blog post with 9 questions at the bottom of the unit.  I assume they'll get one grade for all 11 questions?]  Blog posts in LDRS 627 account for 20% in all so it's a graded activity.  The Reading/Viewing Response assignments account for 50% overall.  </strong>

<h2>Topic 2: Pedagogy and Andragogy</h2>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

Creating a good learning experience for adults is what andragogy is all about. It’s important to keep in mind that the resource of highest value in adult education is the learner’s experience.

Knowles (1980 cited in Merriam &amp; Bierma, 2014, p. 47), outlines six assumptions about andragogy:

<ol>
    <li>As a person matures, his or her self-concept moves from that of a dependent personality toward one of a self-directing human being.</li>
    <li>An adult accumulates a growing reservoir of experience, which is a rich resource for learning.</li>
    <li>The readiness of an adult to learn is closely related to the developmental tasks of his or her social role.</li>
    <li>There is a change in time perspective as people mature – from future application of knowledge to immediacy of application. Thus, an adult is more problem than subject centered in learning.</li>
    <li>Adults are mostly driven by internal motivation, rather than external motivators</li>
    <li>Adults need to know the reason for learning something</li>
</ol>

What is the difference between how children experience something as compared to how adults experience something?  In other words, what’s the difference between pedagogy and andragogy?

Children experience what happens <em>to </em>them while an adult’s experience is <em>who they are</em>.  For the adult, their experience is what makes them unique and makes them who they are; it is an important part of their identity and self-concept. Children, on the other hand, develop their self- identity in reliance on external factors such as family, community, school, and church.  This changes over time as the children matures and starts to identify themselves based on their experiences.

Check out German professor Jost Reischmann’s website at <a href="http://www.andragogy.net">www.andragogy.net</a>. In particular, explore the understanding of andragogy and professionalism as well as the contributions and critiques of Malcolm Knowles work.

<h3>Learning Activity 1</h3>

<strong>[Are any of these questions to be answered in their blog?]</strong>

While reading Brookfield chapter 4, consider how self-directed learning is at the heart<strong> </strong>of adult education.

What is the difference between self-paced learning and self-directed learning?
How does self-directed learning relate to power?
What is the value of a learning audit in self-directed learning?

<h2>Topic 3: Prior Needs Assessment</h2>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

Before you plan to teach anything it’s a good idea to find out what your students already know.  You can save time (and boredom) by not spending time on topics or skills that they already know and instead plan to enhance their knowledge and take them further.  This is a much more motivating approach and one that adults will appreciate.  A prior needs assessment is not always a ‘quiz’ though – it can be a discussion, a concept map, a KWL (Know, Want to Know, Learned), a ‘Minute Paper’….. The idea is to plan a way to learn what the participants already know on the topic. Because they are adults it’s important to recognize their prior life experience. Remember Knowles’ second principle of andragogy as cited in Merriam and Bierema (2014): <em>An adult accumulates a growing reservoir of experience, which is a rich resource for learning.  </em>This is the essential reason for prior learning assessment.

<h3>Learning Activities
Activity 2.2: Reading and Questionaire</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Read Sandlin, J., Redmon Wright R., Clark C. (2013). Reexamining Theories of Adult Learning and Adult Development through the Lenses of Public Pedagogy. <em>Adult Education Quarterly</em> 63:3, 14-16.  (<strong>Note</strong> that only certain pages have been assigned for the Sandlin article. You read part last week and focus on a different section this week.)</li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking about your specific organization, take the department team building questionnaire Silberman p. 375 figure 18.4. </span></li>
</ol>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Identify two or three </span><a href="https://learn.twu.ca/mod/url/view.php?id=36727"><span style="font-weight: 400;">next steps</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> regarding how you can intervene for quality improvement.  <strong>(do we need this hyperlink to the next steps video? If so, let's remind students of the video they watched in Unit 1.)  Yes I think it helps.</strong></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">*State your plan to the C-Suite following the guidelines described on p. 387 and 388.</span>

<h2>Unit 2 Summary</h2>

In this unit you explored critical transformational learning, self directed learning and prior learning assessment within the larger context of power dynamics in the adult education learning environment.  This prepares you for next week's topics of Experience, Emotions and Motivation where we explore ambiguity and brain-friendly teaching.
