<h2>Overview</h2>

Welcome to Leadership 627!  In this first unit you will explore reflective practice and teaching perspectives, critical and transformative learning, and roles and factors impacting adult educators.

It's important for educators to be reflective about their practice and to keep the learning outcomes about the students. This is what is referred to as student-centered learning. Always remember that you are teaching people - not x, y, z subject. If you keep this focus, you will be more attracted to choosing methods that will facilitate critical thinking and this will potentially lead to transformations in the perspectives and lives of your learners. Adult educators are impacted by various societal factors because adult education happens in the world! The key is helping participants analyze their experience critically and figure out how what they are learning 'fits' or challenges their lived experience.

We begin Unit 1 with readings and discussions on adult learning theory and perspectives. While most of the course focuses on practice, it is important to understand some foundational theory so that when you are making choices about resources and strategies, you are able to do so with some reasoned rationale.

In this first unit, you are asked to read two articles and a section of our main text by Melvin L. Silberman. The first article by Collins provides some background on the Teachers’ Perspectives Inventory that you will be completing. The second article discusses theories of adult learning and adult development.

The Silberman pages introduce the practice of active training, which is a powerful method of adult learning we will explore during the course. In this methodology, participants are actively engaged in acquiring knowledge and skill while the educator is a skilled facilitator of learning. We will also discuss the rationale for active engagement techniques and will gain more specific information about individual techniques throughout the course. As you go through the learning activities for this unit, you may find it helpful to take a look at the Reading Response questions posted in Unit 2 so you can read with these in mind, and, possibly answer the questions concurrently as you read. This unit also involves viewing several videos about the Teachers’ Perspectives Inventory. These will help you critically reflect on your own results. Therefore, it is important to complete the survey prior to viewing the videos.

One more note I'd like to emphasize is to please follow the suggested ‘due dates’. The due dates in this course are meant to ‘chunk’ the course into manageable parts so that you are successful. Feel free to ‘go ahead’ but please don’t get behind. Sometimes life throws us ‘curve balls’ so to speak and we might need to take a day away from the course, but please do your best to catch up the very next day. In an asynchronous environment it behooves us all to manage our time so that posts are up on time and ready to be responded to. This will avoid frustration for everyone!
