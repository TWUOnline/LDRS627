# Unit 1: **Adult Learning Theory and Perspectives**

## Overview

Welcome to Leadership 627! In unit one you will explore reflective practice and teaching perspectives, critical and transformative learning, and roles and factors impacting adult educators.

It's important for educators to be reflective about their practice and to keep the learning outcomes about the students. This is what is referred to as student-centered learning. Always remember that you are teaching people - not x, y, z subject. If you keep this focus, you will be more attracted to choosing methods that will facilitate critical thinking and this will potentially lead to transformations in the perspectives and lives of your learners. Adult educators are impacted by various societal factors because adult education happens in the world! The key is helping participants analyze their experience critically and figure out how what they are learning 'fits' or challenges their lived experience.

We begin Unit 1 with readings and discussions on adult learning theory and perspectives. While most of the course focuses on practice, it is important to understand some foundational theory so that when you are making choices about resources and strategies you are able to do so with some reasoned rationale.

In this first unit, you are asked to read two articles and a section of our main text by Melvin L. Silberman. The first article by Collins provides some background on the Teachers’ Perspectives Inventory that you will be completing. The second article discusses theories of adult learning and adult development.

The Silberman pages introduce the practice of active training which is a powerful method of adult learning we will explore during the course. In this methodology, participants are actively engaged in acquiring knowledge and skill while the educator is a skilled facilitator of learning. We will also discuss the rationale for active engagement techniques and will gain more specific information about individual techniques throughout the course. As you go through the learning activities for this unit, you may find it helpful to take a look at the Reading Response questions posted in Unit 2 so you can read with these in mind, and, possibly answer the questions concurrently as you read. This unit also involves viewing several videos about the Teachers’ Perspectives Inventory. These will help you critically reflect on your own results. Therefore, it is important to complete the survey prior to viewing the videos – please follow the suggested ‘due dates’. About the due dates, these are meant to ‘chunk’ the course into manageable parts so that you are successful. Feel free to ‘go ahead’ but please don’t get behind. Sometimes life throws us ‘curve balls’ so to speak and we might need to take a day away from the course, but please do your best to catch up the very next day. In an asynchronous environment it behooves us all to manage our time so that posts are up on time and ready to be responded to. This will avoid frustration for everyone!

## Topics

Unit 1 is divided into 3 topics: Topic 1: Reflective Practice and Teaching Perspectives Topic 2: Critical and Transformative Learning Topic 3: Roles and Factors Impacting Adult Educators

## Learning Outcomes

When you have completed this unit you should be able to:

* express the key features found in the theory of adult education.
* assess the active and engaged training method.
* describe what it means to be a facilitator of learning.

## Activity Checklist

Here is a checklist of learning activities you will benefit from in completing this unit. You may find it useful for planning your work.

**Activities**

Activity 1: Take the Teaching Perspectives Inventory.

Activity 2: Watch the TPI videos and complete Part A of your blog

Activity 3: Read the Cahalan, Collin and Sandlin articles as well as the Silberman and Wang chapters as indicated.

Assignment 1: Complete Blog Part A. Assignment 2: Complete Blog Part B. Assignment 3: Respond substantively to at least two other classmates' blogs.

## Topic 1: Reflective Practice and Teaching perspectives

**Introduction** We begin this topic by taking a look at your ideas about teaching and learning and how these relate to the role of the teacher and learner in adult education. Think about your experience as a student. What helped you be an engaged learner? What are the differences between teaching and learning adults and teaching and learning children or adolescents? An adult educator needs to assume that participants have prior knowledge and experience and that adults are very interested in the application of whatever they are learning. Keeping in mind these principles of andragogy (adult teaching and learning; as opposed to pedagogy, child and adolescent teaching and learning) will help you become a facilitator of learning.

### Learning Activities

#### Activity 1: Teaching Practices Inventory

Take the [Teaching Practices Inventory](http://www.teachingperspectives.com/tpi/). It has 45 questions and should take you about 10-15 minutes to complete.

#### Activity 2: Videos and Blog

View the following videos that will help you interpret your TPI results.

* [TPI as a conversational Tool](http://youtu.be/9GN7nN6YnXg)
* [Orientation to a Profile](http://youtu.be/1oz1oPE34OM)
* [Deconstructing a Profile](http://youtu.be/EHy76iHn3Ls)
* [Next Steps](http://youtu.be/4IB7OhP6k28)

Using the videos as a guide, interpret your own TPI results focusing on your dominant perspectives. Then complete part A of your blog. **Answer the following questions in your blog:** a) Does your profile match your self-perception or how others see you? Are there any discrepancies? b) With respect to teaching adults, what are your [next steps](https://learn.twu.ca/mod/url/view.php?id=36727)?

## Topic 2: Critical and Transformative Learning

**Introduction** **The remainder of the readings focus on important aspects of adult learning theory and the role of the adult educator.** [Can we focus on content and not readings by deleting this? And perhaps have a different lead-in sentence? Here are examples] **What kind of focus will you have as an educator? What techniques will you use to ensure your students have a meaningful learning experience?** If you keep a learner-centered focus you will be more attracted to choosing methods that will facilitate critical thinking and this will potentially lead to transformations in the perspectives and lives of your learners. On Jan. 9, 2017 MA LEAD student Christel Davidson wrote the following post entitled ‘Designing Our Boxes’ for another course. I quote it here, with her permission. _“__Critical transformational learning is a holistic learning practice that helps people to crawl out of their boxes, experience the space outside the box and then reconstruct their next box which in turn they will crawl out of again and repeat over and over again. I say they will reconstruct their box each time because as human beings we need boundaries to our thought, actions and emotions, and without them, we become unsure of whether anything is concrete or valid, so to feel safe we have our boxes. This is perfectly alright as long as we don't get stuck in the same box forever._ _The value of critical transformational learning is that there is a personal intentionality to the process. This can be guided by an educator or it can happen independently. Each time the learner temporarily exits the box to take a fresh view of life, it is not to throw the person into a state of chaos or abandonment of absolutes, but to give a moment where thoughts can be free to explore other possible points of view or to reflect on habits and unconscious actions that are rooted in their beliefs. Once challenged or left open for review, a critical analysis can be made, conclusions drawn and a shifted belief or value stabilized, by restating or redesigning their box._ _There are endless ways that this can be accomplished, so long as the process evokes the emotions, stimulates the soul and matures the mind.”_ Critical thinking is an essential component of leadership because there is an intelligence to practice. This practical wisdom or phronesis is an intellectual virtue incorporating discernment and judgment and is enhanced through practice. How does one learn through practice? According to Cahalan (2016) there are eight _Ways_ _of_ _Knowing_ essential to wise practice:

* Situated awareness
* Embodied realizing
* Conceptual understanding
* Critical thinking
* Emotional attunement
* Creative insight
* Spiritual discernment
* Practical reasoning

Experiential learning can lead to wisdom if experience is accompanied by critical thinking and intentionally grounded in values and beliefs about what is good. This wisdom is transformational both personally and professionally.

## Topic 3: Roles and Factors Impacting Adult Educators

**Introduction** Adult educators are impacted by various societal factors because adult education happens in the world! The key is helping participants analyze their experience critically, and figuring out how what they are learning 'fits' or challenges their lived experience. Adult educators are encouraged to establish authentic relationships with students by building trust through caring for students, respecting them and showing interest in what is important to them. One of my favorite things to remember is that the teaching is not about me, it is about the students’ learning. In anything I do as a teacher, I should ask myself “How does this contribute to the students’ learning? It is helpful to reflect on Brazilian philosopher, Rubem Alves (1979) comments that everything is interpretation: “Language functions as a mediation tool between humans and their world. As humans, we don’t contemplate reality face to face. Since birth, things in our world don’t come to us in their naked form, but always dressed up in the names our community has given them. This community has already defined how and what the world is like and, therefore, already knows it (the world). This knowledge of the world is crystallized in our language. Language, therefore, is not a copy of objects and facts. Language is always interpretation” (cited in Goodson 2013, p.47). Eventually you will be able to help your students engage in the demanding tasks of reflection, critical analysis and academic thinking and writing with less effortful deliberation.

### Learning Activities

Activity 4: KWL Chart [Kelly please put this chart on the home page of the course site. It will be an ongoing activity - every other week eg 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 so that it alternates with the Reading Response assignments due weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.]

Know

Want to know

Learned

Considering the roles and factors impacting adult educators, add to the KWL chart. A KWL chart is a graphic organizer that helps us jot down our ideas about what we know, what we want to know, and what we have learned. This chart is one that all course participants will contribute to throughout the ten week course in weeks 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9. This week, answer, in point form , the following questions in the chart: What do you KNOW about the role of an adult educator and factors impacting adult educators? What do you WANT TO KNOW about the role of an adult educator and factors impacting adult educators? What have you LEARNED so far about the role of an adult educator and factors impacting adult educators?

## Checking your Learning
