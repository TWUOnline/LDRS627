<h2>Activity 10.6: Blog Assignment (%)</h2>
Write a blog commenting on three of the competencies of adult educators described in Adult Education Teacher Competencies.  What is significant about each of these?  What is going to be your top growth area or focus as you embark on refining your skill set in this field?  (This may be one of the three or a different competency.)

&nbsp;

Make a personal growth plan for the top growth area or focus you identified.  Use the SMART goals <a href="https://www.smartsheet.com/blog/essential-guide-writing-smart-goals">template</a> and include this with your blog as a public commitment to your growth.

&nbsp;
<h2>Activity 10.7: Learning Design Assignment (30%)</h2>
Submit your revised Adult Learning Design Assignment.

Sketch out the design of one lesson or session of 3-6 hours length that will be useful to you in your work. It may be a formal lesson within an educational institution or a (corporate) training program.

Your design document will utilize the following organizational structure: (use titles)

Institutional Context (Where?)

Intents (Why?)
<ul>
 	<li>Problem Identification</li>
 	<li>Learner Analysis</li>
 	<li>Learning Outcomes/Objectives</li>
 	<li>Integration of Transformational Servant Leadership and Values Based Leadership.</li>
</ul>
Activities (How?)

Learning Activity (What?)

Program Sequence (When?)

Resources (With What?)

Assessment (What was Learned?)

Use the course textbooks to guide your thinking and structure the content within each of the above sections.
