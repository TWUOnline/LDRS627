<h1>Unit 2<br />Power, Self-Directed Learning, Transformative Learning</h1>

Teachers have power! Students have power! The dynamic interplay between these in a learning environment can create a positive, safe and authentic experience<strong>,</strong> or one wrought with tension, confusion and ‘second guessing’. Part of preparing to be an adult educator is being aware of your power as well as the power among students<strong>,</strong> and between students and you. Why is it necessary to know about this? Because adults (and that includes both the educator and the participants) have a lifetime of experiences, ideas, prejudices, misinformation, biases, and brilliance that they bring to the learning environment and these all impact learning.
