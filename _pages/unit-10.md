Unit 10: Using the creative arts in teaching, team learning and adult educator competencies
<h1>Overview</h1>
In this final unit of LDRS 627 you will explore using the creative arts in teaching, team learning and adult educator competencies.

Our first topic focuses on using the create arts in teaching. Even if you don’t consider yourself particularly ‘artistic’ this is indeed possible!  Keep in mind that most educators are linguistic learners and, since we tend to teach the way we prefer to learn, it is important for us to break out of our ‘comfort zone’ and try something new from time to time. The effort to relate content in creative ways has the potential to reach students in new and inspiring ways.

The next topic relates to team learning. If you took LDRS 502, you learned that in the contemporary leadership paradigm, leaders no longer control and determine, they are more likely to guide, influence, and respond. This is also true of adult educators. Decisions are more often made in groups or teams that embrace a variety of views and interests in a flexible environment that remains responsive to change. Group exercises in the classroom help learners to work with others in a collaborative manner toward a common goal as they practice communication and problem solving skills.

The final subtopic of this unit is a wrap up topic for the course. You are asked to consider where your skills are as an adult educator and where you still need to learn and grow.  This course has surveyed a myriad of techniques, approaches and dispositions in adult education and it is important to critically reflect on your learning, making plans for your future development.
