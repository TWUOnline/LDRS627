<!--themify_builder_static--><h1>Unit 10<br />Using the Creative Arts in Teaching, Team Learning and Adult Educator Competencies</h1>
 <p>In this final unit of LDRS 627 you will explore using the creative arts in teaching, team learning and adult educator competencies.</p> <p>Our first topic focuses on using the create arts in teaching. Even if you don’t consider yourself particularly ‘artistic’ this is indeed possible!  Keep in mind that most educators are linguistic learners and, since we tend to teach the way we prefer to learn, it is important for us to break out of our ‘comfort zone’ and try something new from time to time. The effort to relate content in creative ways has the potential to reach students in new and inspiring ways.</p>
