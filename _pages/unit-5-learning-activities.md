<h1>Topic 1: Critical Thinking in Graduate Studies</h1>

<strong>Introduction</strong>

In graduate studies you are expected to think critically, analyze the assertions of others and propose your own ideas based on reasoned evidence and your <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/phronesis">phronesis</a>.  The currency of graduate level studies is peer reviewed journal publications.  Citing journals is preferred to citing websites or newspapers.  Your professors will be able to recommend the journals most prestigious and appropriate in their discipline.

Peer reviewed journals:

<ul>
    <li>are the principal means through which knowledge is advanced</li>
    <li>differ from articles published in newspapers and magazines and from chapters published in books</li>
    <li>are based on evidence and research (whereas articles in newspapers and magazines often express opinions – with generally meager rationale or evidence)</li>
    <li>are sometimes difficult to read due to jargon</li>
    <li>sometimes have weak implications for policy or practice which can limit the good that leaders can gain from reading journals</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;

Here are four good reasons to read journal articles (adapted from Chong, 2015):

<ol>
    <li>At some point, students should have firsthand exposure to journal articles.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li>Journals are where the vast majority of researchers report their procedures, findings and limitations.</li>
    <li>In order to understand where new ideas come from, and how fields advance or not, students, especially graduate level students must venture into scholarly journals.</li>
    <li>To encounter social science only through textbooks seems comparable to an English student learning about literature only by reading Coles or Cliff notes or by watching the movie.</li>
</ul>

<ol start="2">
    <li>Learning to evaluate journal articles can make you a better researcher.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li>If you become a critical consumer of research, then you can find weaknesses in the existing literature. This is useful for interrogating one’s own work as well as the work of others.  You can then pursue your projects with more confidence.</li>
</ul>

<ol start="3">
    <li>Learning to evaluate journal articles can be useful for a variety of careers.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li>Do we want our doctors to stop learning the moment they leave medical school? No!</li>
    <li>We need to engage in continuous education and attempt to stay current on research that pertains to our jobs and responsibilities.</li>
    <li>Knowledge is power and also a responsibility.  Servant leaders want the best for the people they lead.</li>
</ul>

<ol start="4">
    <li>Learning to evaluate journal articles might prove useful whenever you want greater insight into your life or the world around you.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li>Reading the relevant literature can give you a much deeper and more nuanced perspective on social life compared to what is found in ordinary conversation.</li>
    <li>This can make you more intelligent and give you interesting things to contribute the next time the subject comes up.</li>
    <li>You will be able to provide a calmer and thoughtful voice with less judgment and more nuances.</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;

How does a grad student use critical thinking with peer-reviewed journals? If they have been "approved" and published, how can a person "critique" them? Isn’t that intellectually presumptuous?  These articles are written by experts in the field but when you read them, know that:

<ul>
    <li>Authors make decisions about what to include.</li>
    <li>Authors contradict other authors.</li>
    <li>Authors neglect to mention information.</li>
    <li>There are differences in their theoretical orientations, definitions, measurement strategies, and findings.</li>
    <li>Authors use information selectively and sometimes misleadingly.</li>
    <li>Sometimes authors neglect to define terms.</li>
    <li>Sometimes there are ambiguities in terms.</li>
    <li>Sometimes articles define terms differently.</li>
    <li>Sometimes authors implicitly define terms.</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;

Use your critical thinking as you’re reading and ask:

<ul>
    <li>Are there some important concepts that they authors could have defined but didn’t?</li>
    <li>Did the writer fail to include some research you’ve read about in another article in favour or highlighting research that supports their findings?</li>
    <li>Can I find a quote where the authors tried to explicitly or implicitly define one or two key concepts?</li>
    <li>Can I provide a concrete example that supports or contradicts the author’s definition of terms?</li>
    <li>Are there ethical implications with respect to the methodology or findings?</li>
    <li>Does the writer have a political agenda? (Who funded the study? What is the writer’s implicit or stated bias?)</li>
    <li>Does the structure of the article support the thesis clearly and logically?</li>
    <li>Does the article contain a section that outlines and reviews previous studies on this topic?</li>
    <li>If the author explained procedures that were followed, are these clear enough that they could be repeated and get similar results?</li>
    <li>How can I compare and contrast varying theoretical perspectives on the topic?</li>
    <li>Is it possible to show how approaches to the topic have changed over time?</li>
    <li>How does what I’m reading intersect with policies and procedures in my field?</li>
    <li>Are there biases or stereotypes represented in what I’m reading?</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;

In order to get a good sense of a topic, the following recommended process inspired by the work of Chong (2015) and Goodson (2013) may be helpful:

<ul>
    <li>Do an initial search of recommended databases and find all the "hits" from your key word searches. For example, go to the TWU Library Website and search for “Teaching in China”. See also the following document of <a href="http://create.twu.ca/ldrs627-su18/files/2018/06/U5_Databases-in-Education.docx">useful databases in Education</a>.</li>
    <li>Read the abstracts of these hits and move the articles that have potential value to your research questions into a file on your computer.</li>
    <li>Now narrow down those articles to the top 12-15 articles most relevant to your research.</li>
    <li>Once you have about 12-15 good peer-reviewed articles, you are ready to read.</li>
    <li>Read all the articles and highlight relevant information, make notes in the margins etc. Look for themes, contradictions, and interesting quotes.</li>
    <li>Once you’ve read all the articles, you can make a rough outline or plan for your paper and then start writing your paper.</li>
    <li>Be careful not to over-quote. Paraphrase and use your own thinking and ideas about how what the writers are saying applies to your particular context. To decide whether or not to quote, consider if the words are strikingly original or express your key concepts so compellingly that the quotation can frame an extended discussion; if the passage states a view that you disagree with, and to be fair you want to quote it exactly; if the words are from an authority who backs up your claims. This is critical thinking!</li>
    <li>Remember, critical thinking means that when you are writing your papers you are not merely reporting the related literature. You are expected to evaluate, organize, synthesize what others have done and also to think about the implications for your practice, in your context.</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;

You learn critical thinking through the practice of thinking critically.  It is helpful to reflect on Brazilian philosopher, Rubem Alves (1979), who comments that everything is interpretation:

“Language functions as a mediation tool between humans and their world. As humans, we don’t contemplate reality face to face. Since birth, things in our world don’t come to us in their naked form, but always dressed up in the names our community has given them. This community has already defined how and what the world is like and, therefore, already knows it (the world). This knowledge of the world is crystallized in our language. Language, therefore, is not a copy of objects and facts. Language is always interpretation” (cited in Goodson 2013, p. 47).

Eventually you will be able to engage in the demanding tasks of academic thinking and writing with less effortful analysis or deliberation. However, it is through the effort and struggle that you’ll improve so stay with it. Welcome to the academe!

<h3>Activity 5.2: Read &amp; Reflect</h3>

Read the article: <a href="http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/developing-as-rational-persons-viewing-our-development-in-stages/518">Develop as Rational Persons: Viewing our development in stages </a>and determine which stage you are at in your rational development. Figuring out which stage we are at can help us “t<em>o think less egocentrically and irrationally in our personal lives. If we can understand where we are in our own development, if we can envision a series of stages through which we can imagine ourselves moving, we will be more likely to develop along those lines. If we can more concretely and realistically conceptualize how to go about acquiring the knowledge, skills, and dispositions which characterize highly developed critical thinkers, then, we will more effectively gain that knowledge and acquire those skills and dispositions.”</em>

<h1>Topic 2: The significance of critical thinking in adult learning and life.</h1>

<strong>Introduction</strong>

Brookfield discusses three parts to a typical critical thinking sequence:

<ol>
    <li>Modeling</li>
    <li>Scenario Analysis</li>
    <li>Critical Conversation Protocol</li>
</ol>

In your reading of Brookfield’s <em>Powerful techniques for teaching adults</em>, pay particular attention to p. 37 and the "disorienting dilemma" or moving people beyond their "zone of proximal development."  The effective adult educator is meant to create these moments of dissonance to lead the learner to new perspectives and learning. Think about how you can do this in the adult learning design you will create for your Lesson Assignment.

In regards to modelling critical thinking, Brookfield speaks to the significance of "spatial difference:" the act, by the instructor, of speaking from a different perspective when situated in a different area of the room.  Critical thinking encourages considering alternate perspectives than your own.  When the instructor engages in spatial difference, he or she is modeling taking in and taking on a perspective other than their own.

Wang (2017) outlines in chapter 5 how learning is socially constructed which corresponds beautifully with Silberman and the many methods suggested for adults to learn in collaboration.  In the MA Lead we have a Community of Practice whereby all alum and current students are invited to a learning event three times a year with the intention of sharing practice, learning from each other and building relationships.  Because all participants have communal understandings gathered from their participation in the program, they have shared stories and practices and a similar way of viewing the world within a social context.  An important concept in chapter 5 is that learning “is not merely influenced by social context… but shaped by the extent of participant engagement in practice” (p. 120).

&nbsp;

<h3>Activity 5.3: Read &amp; Reflect</h3>

Read Brookfield, S. (2013). <em>Powerful techniques for teaching adults</em>. Chapter 2.

Focus on the parts of a critical thinking sequence, the importance of a "disorienting dilemma" and some of the strategies Brookfield recommends.  Take note of any ideas that you could use in your learning design assignment.

&nbsp;

<h3>Activity 5.4: Video Resources</h3>

View the <a href="http://youtu.be/Y8umk4w8kB8%20%20Critical%20Thinking">video</a> of Brookfield giving a one hour lecture on critical thinking.  Pay attention to the reasons for the importance of critical thinking he introduces as well as the strategies you might engage in your context.  Take note of these.

Next, watch two short videos about critical thinking in life and work contexts:

<ol>
    <li><a href="https://youtu.be/2yEZHXgQKsM">Video</a> of author, professional speaker and entrepreneur Mark Sanborn (2 minutes)</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTWc-JLh3Fw&amp;feature=youtu.be">Video</a> of author, professional speaker, executive coach and consultant Mark Sikora (2 minutes).</li>
</ol>

Note what resonates for you.

&nbsp;

<h3>Activity 5.5: Read &amp; Reflect</h3>

Read Wang, C. X. (2017). <em>Theory and Practice of Adult and Higher Education</em>. Information Age Publishing Inc. Chapters 5, 17.

What theories of adult learning most resonate with you and why? If someone were to ask you "Upon what basis do you design your adult learning sessions?" how would you answer?

<strong> </strong>

<h1>Topic 3: Techniques for Fostering Critical Thinking</h1>

<strong>Introduction</strong>

If we as adult educators are going to help adults learn, we need to acknowledge that life itself is the main learning event (Wang, p. 127).  In order to foster learning, we need to establish a sort of cognitive apprenticeship (Collins, Vygotsky, 1991) by employing techniques that make our thinking visible to our learners and also help make their thinking visible to us. Creating interactive learning environments including observational and collaborative methods is key to effective adult learning and enhancement of self-efficacy.

The design of this course is predicated on the following beliefs about adult learning that place a primary emphasis on the role of critical thinking. I hope you too will appropriate these principles for your own practice (Brookfield, 2013; Knowles, 1970; Merriam &amp; Caffarella, 1999; Schon, 1983; Vygotsky, 1978):

<ol>
    <li>Adults are self-directed and self-motivated. This does not mean that adults learn in isolation but that they are in charge of their own learning and held accountable.</li>
    <li>Adults have prior experiences that are rich resources for learning. The adult learner integrates new learning into what they already know.</li>
    <li>Adults appreciate the application of theory "in the real world."</li>
    <li>Adults are responsible for their own learning and exhibit behaviors of an individual ready and wanting to learn.</li>
    <li>As an expert in the field, the instructor is a facilitator of learning – not a "sage on the stage" but a "guide on the side."</li>
    <li>Assignments are designed to challenge the learner, build upon concepts and encourage reflection on experience.</li>
    <li>Adults collaborate and support one another in their learning rather than compete. Everyone is capable of doing well.</li>
    <li>Self-reflection, dialogue, writing and collaborative small group work are essential in sense-making and learning. Rote memory and lecture are deemphasized.</li>
</ol>

Silberman and Biech (2015) outline many helpful adult learning methods. As Silberman says, "Preparation is one of the most important ingredients for success" (p. 207).  He goes on to explain how to gain credibility as a trainer by setting group norms, eliminating time wasters, being able to getting the group’s attention, winning over wary participants and managing difficult behaviors (p. 208).  More details and specific strategies are recommended in chapters 11-15.

&nbsp;

<h2>Activity 5.6: Read &amp; Reflect</h2>

Read Silberman &amp; Biech (2015) chapters 11-15 and focus your attention on the following key questions for each chapter:

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Chapter 11 – What are the four ways to establish rapport with participants and get training off to a good start?</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Chapter 12 – How can you foster group norms and facilitate effectively?</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Chapter 13 – What impact do your facilitation behaviors make?</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Chapter 14 – How can you motivate participants and get buy in?</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Chapter 15 – How can you best review content and wrap up sessions?</p>

&nbsp;

<h2>Activity 5.7: Blog Assignment</h2>

Write a blog post on the following:  Consider Brookfield and Silberman and discuss how you can build adult education learning experiences that would assist participants to think deeply through a question, issue or problem.  Keeping in mind Wang’s assertion that learning “is not merely influenced by social context… but shaped by the extent of participant engagement in practice” (p. 120), be more practical than theoretical in your response; include illustrative examples of adult learning techniques representing three of the eight principles of adult learning listed above.

&nbsp;

<h1>Unit Summary</h1>
