<h1>Assessment:</h1>

Write a Blog Post:  Consider Brookfield and Silberman and discuss how you can build adult education learning experiences that would assist participants to think deeply through a question, issue or problem.  Keeping in mind Wang’s assertion that learning “is not merely influenced by social context… but shaped by the extent of participant engagement in practice” (p. 120), be more practical than theoretical in your response; include illustrative examples.

<h1>Checking your Learning</h1>

Use the learning outcomes for this unit as a checklist of understanding before you move to the next unit.

<ul>
    <li>Can you define critical thinking?</li>
    <li>Can you explain the significance of critical thinking in graduate studies?</li>
    <li>Can you explain the significance of critical thinking in adult learning?</li>
    <li>Can you analyze and discern which methods foster critical thinking and lead learners to new perspectives and learning?</li>
</ul>
