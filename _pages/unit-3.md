<h2>Unit 3  Experience, Emotions and Motivation</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
In this unit, we explore different ways of knowing - through experience and emotions <strong> - </strong>and <strong>we consider </strong>how these impact <strong>one's </strong>motivation to learn. Jesus, the greatest teacher of all time, wasn't afraid to be emotional. It seems as though he used wisdom as to when he chose to open his heart to people, but part of the substance that bonded Jesus and his disciples was his ability to engage them at a deep level. <strong>[this sentence is hard to follow and a little confusing.  Can we simplify?  "Jesus chose when to open up to people..." - although I'm still not sure what you mean by Jesus opening up his heart. Reading it again, it makes it sound as if he was stand-offish to others (closed his heart). Then the next part of the sentence maybe we could simplify as well: "and part of what bonded Jesus..."</strong>

As he approached Jerusalem at the beginning of possibly the most important week in the history of civilization (the week he died and rose again), he exposed his emotions and revealed his heart to those around him <strong>[were these his disciples, or others as well? We may want to point this out in this or the next sentence]</strong>. “As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it and said, “If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace—but now it is hidden from your eyes” (Luke 19:41-43).  This unit invites exploration into how can we bring emotion into our teaching and the science underlying the role of emotion in learning.
<h3>Topics</h3>
Unit 3 is divided into 3 topics:

Topic 1: Emotions and teaching

Topic 2: Neuroscience and teaching
Topic 3: Experiential learning
<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
When you have completed this unit you should be able to:
<ul>
 	<li>explain why being comfortable with ambiguity and challenged by what others think is central to learning as an adult.</li>
 	<li>design brain-friendly teaching methods.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Activity Checklist</h3>
Here is a checklist of learning activities you will benefit from in completing this unit. You may find it useful for planning your work. <strong>[Adrienne, here is where we'll give a quick checklist, but the details will be below when we introduce the activity to the students in the lesson.  I've just guessed that the first two are </strong>
<ol>
 	<li>View the videos ‘Chaos Theory’ and 'How I learned to embrace chaos'</li>
 	<li>Read: Brookfield, S. (2013).<em> Powerful techniques for teaching adults.</em> (Ch.8)</li>
 	<li>Read: Silberman, M. L., &amp; Biech, E. (2015). <em>Active training: A handbook of techniques, designs, case examples, and tips</em> (4th ed.). (Ch 4-6) Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons</li>
 	<li>Read: Wang, . C. X. (2017). <em>Theory and Practice of Adult and Higher Education</em>. Information Age Publishing Inc. Chapter 11</li>

<strong>[Adrienne, you had listed these next questions as activities, but I wasn't sure where you want them.  Before the topics (as here), after the unit overview above, or part of Topic 1?</strong>

Before reading on to the topics, answer the following questions in your notes:
<ul>
 	<li>Identify what emotions and feeling have hindered or stopped your own learning as an adult and how you could design to avoid a similar hindrance for someone else.</li>
 	<li>As you think about the teaching methods of Jesus, or another religious teacher, what stands out? Does anything surprise you?</li>
</ul>
