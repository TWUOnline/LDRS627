Please take about ten minutes to respond to the questions below.  If nothing comes to mind for any of the questions just leave the space blank. Thanks for taking the time to do this.  What you write will help me make the class more responsive to your concerns.

 

At what moment in class these few weeks did you feel most engaged with what was happening?

 

 

 

 

 

 

At what moment in class these few weeks were you most distanced from what was happening?

 

 

 

 

 

 

What action that anyone (teacher or student) took these few weeks did you find most affirming or helpful?

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What action that anyone took these few weeks did you find most puzzling or confusing?

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

What about the class so far surprised you the most? (This could be about your own reactions to what went on, something that someone did, or anything else that occurs).

Considering how &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.twu.ca/mod/resource/view.php?id=36737&quot;&gt;change&lt;/a&gt;, chance, complexity and uncertainty impact adult education and life-long learning, what actions can you take to design learning experiences that respect body, spirit, and emotions - as related to your context?

| Activity 2:| | |  Blog Post

Identify what emotions and feeling have hindered or stopped your own learning as an adult and how you could design to avoid a similar hindrance for someone else.
