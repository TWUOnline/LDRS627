<h1>Unit 3<br/>Experience, Emotions and Motivation (Overview)</h1>

In this unit, we explore different ways of knowing - through experience and emotions - and consider how these impact motivation to learn. Jesus, the greatest teacher of all time, wasn't afraid to be emotional. In Lk 19. 41-42 we hear of His great disappointment and frustration that He cannot help Jerusalem and its people. The people of Jerusalem do not accept His message of justice and peace. Jesus is so upset that He weeps. Part of what bonded Jesus to people was his ability to engage them at a deep level.
