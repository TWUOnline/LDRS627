<h2>Unit 3  Experience, Emotions and Motivation</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
In this unit, we explore different ways of knowing - through experience and emotions <strong> - </strong>and <strong>we consider </strong>how these impact <strong>one's </strong>motivation to learn. Jesus, the greatest teacher of all time, wasn't afraid to be emotional. It seems as though he used wisdom as to when he chose to open his heart to people, but part of the substance that bonded Jesus and his disciples was his ability to engage them at a deep level. <strong>[this sentence is hard to follow and a little confusing.  Can we simplify?  "Jesus chose when to open up to people..." - although I'm still not sure what you mean by Jesus opening up his heart. Reading it again, it makes it sound as if he was stand-offish to others (closed his heart). Then the next part of the sentence maybe we could simplify as well: "and part of what bonded Jesus..."</strong>

As he approached Jerusalem at the beginning of possibly the most important week in the history of civilization (the week he died and rose again), he exposed his emotions and revealed his heart to those around him <strong>[were these his disciples, or others as well? We may want to point this out in this or the next sentence]</strong>. “As he approached Jerusalem and saw the city, he wept over it and said, “If you, even you, had only known on this day what would bring you peace—but now it is hidden from your eyes” (Luke 19:41-43).  This unit invites exploration into how can we bring emotion into our teaching and the science underlying the role of emotion in learning.

<strong>[Can we also mention experiential learning in the overview?]</strong>
<h3>Topics</h3>
Unit 3 is divided into 3 topics:

Topic 1: Emotions and teaching

Topic 2: Neuroscience and teaching
Topic 3: Experiential learning

<strong>[Do we need to mention motivation in the topics?]</strong>
<h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
When you have completed this unit you should be able to:
<ul>
 	<li>explain why being comfortable with ambiguity and challenged by what others think is central to learning as an adult.</li>
 	<li>design brain-friendly teaching methods.</li>
</ul>
<strong>[Adrienne, could we have some outcomes related to emotion, as that seems to be the main part of the lesson.  Also, we should have an outcome about experiential learning, and perhaps motivation as well]</strong>
<h3>Activity Checklist</h3>
Here is a checklist of learning activities you will benefit from in completing this unit. You may find it useful for planning your work. <strong>[Adrienne, here is where we'll give a quick checklist, but the details will be below when we introduce the activity to the students in the lesson.  I've just guessed that the first videos are in topic one, and the rest are in topic two, but please move around the resources in the topics for when the students should read them] </strong>

<strong>[Adrienne, you had listed these next questions as activities, but I wasn't sure where you want them.  Before the topics (as here), after the unit overview above, or part of Topic 1?</strong>

Before reading on to the topics, answer the following questions in your notes:
<ul>
 	<li>Identify what emotions and feeling have hindered or stopped your own learning as an adult and how you could design to avoid a similar hindrance for someone else.</li>
 	<li>As you think about the teaching methods of Jesus, or another religious teacher, what stands out? Does anything surprise you?</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>[Topics will go on a separate page]</strong>
<h2>Topic 1: Emotions and teaching</h2>
<h4>Introduction</h4>
There is a need for us to be disturbed - sounds odd, but read on!  <strong>Below I've included (take out </strong>I want to include) parts of a reflection by Margaret Wheatley about the need for us to be disturbed in order to learn.  I’ve adapted it here for our class perspective<strong>, but click <a href="https://www.ode.state.or.us/opportunities/grants/saelp/willing-to-be-disturbed.pdf">here</a> if you want to read the full text.</strong>

<strong>[In reading this first paragraph and the next ones, it's a little confusing as to where you're quoting from Wheatley, paraphrasing, or using your own words.  Can we just have the instructor's voice talking about Wheatley, as this might flow better.]</strong>

What does our willingness to be disturbed have to do with adult education?  Well this perspective certainly affects emotions, experience and motivation – the focus of this week’s reading. Our willingness to have our beliefs and ideas challenged by what others think is central to learning as an adult. Adult educators are continual learners that realize we can only find answers by admitting we don’t know. We have to be willing to let go of our certainty and expect ourselves to be confused – at least for awhile. <strong>[Is this paragraph a paraphrase?  If so, let's state that Wheatley says this, and/or perhaps make it italics?]</strong>

<strong>In her book, <em>Turning to One Another: Simple Conversations to Restore Hope to the Future</em>, Wheatley states: </strong>“Curiosity is what we need. We don’t have to let go of what we believe, but we do need to be curious about what someone else believes. We do need to acknowledge that their way of interpreting the world might be essential to our survival.” <strong>(Wheatly, 2002...) [Can we include the page number if it is a direct quote?]</strong>

Wheatley also says that “we can’t be creative if we refuse to be confused. Change always starts with confusion; cherished interpretations must dissolve to make way for the new.”  This is ‘disruption’ of our status quo but it can lead to creativity and innovation.  So, don’t be afraid to be confused!

Brookfield (p. 230-231) speaks about ‘anticipatory anxiety’ which is connected to this emotion of confusion discussed by Wheatley.  If we are to foster curiosity and be okay with being confused, we may well get anxious!  That would be natural.  By admitting we don’t know something we may feel like an imposter at work – like we are a permanent rookie or novice who doesn’t really deserve to be doing the work. That too is anxiety provoking!

Brookfield suggests that adult learners and facilitators can deal with these emotions through breathing and bodily exercises, talking it out, and cognitive therapy scripts. People who acknowledge the spiritual in their life - regardless of creed, also have other exercises that can be very helpful, such as prayer. If you go to <a href="http://www.spiritatwork.com">www.spiritatwork.com</a>  you will see some ideas for how to live spirituality at work, in a secular environment. <strong>[This website doesn't seem to exist anymore, but goes to Edgewalkers.  Could you double check the source?] </strong>Adult educators can also deliberately incorporate elements of the ‘spiritual’ into the learning experiences they design – not necessarily related to a particular faith but in a way that responds to that emotional, spiritual part of what it means to be human.

Emotions, self-directed learning and transformative learning are connected to the spiritual aspect of what it means to be human. <strong>As the writer of this course and an adult educator, I would like to share with you...[Just a reminder that there will be a different instructor for this course, so perhaps a lead-in like this will make more sense to students] </strong>I will now share with you a personal reflection on my thoughts about spirituality as an adult educator.  You may not relate to these and you don’t have to agree, I’m just sharing, as a servant leader, my personal experience.  As adult educators, sharing personal experiences can be a wonderful way to connect with your learners. I hope that is what this accomplishes.

I would describe myself as a thinker. At times, I will say very little while other times I talk to help process.  It depends largely on my emotions at the time and who I am with. Adult educators who try to be servant leaders need to listen well and deeply. For me, deep listening often leads to a <em>gut feeling</em> about something; that feeling very rarely, if ever, lets me down.  My emotions are no doubt also tied to a belief that I have God-given gifts – and I’m still discovering them. These gifts motivate me to live my mission – to educate for the common good in a way that is just, merciful and humbly rooted in God.  This mission statement comes from Micah 6:8, my favourite scripture: <em>"Do Justice, love mercy and walk humbly with your God.</em>

<strong>[Adrienne, maybe we can add a picture of you here as well - just another way to connect the writer to the readers - teacher to students/teachers-in-training]</strong>

As leaders and educators we need to be ‘grounded’ and self-aware so that we understand our emotions, our reactions, triggers and stressors. Part of the way I try to accomplish this is through PRH which is an acronym for the French ‘<a href="http://www.prh-international.org/index.php/en/?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=161">Personnalite et Relations Humaines’</a> – Personality and Human Relationships.  It’s been a way to discover both my gifts and who I am truly; deeply. It is a non-denominational international school of education that I have been involved with since 2006.  I find the systematic processes and overall structure to be highly effective personal development. What are the ways you access embodied and spiritual learning? How do you ‘stay grounded’?

<strong>[I feel I've lost the flow/purpose of the topic, in the above paragraph and this one below - I'm trying to connect it to the main topic or learning outcome. Can we make it more explicit?]</strong>

The opposite of ‘grounded’ may be restlessness; emotions that are chaotic.  <strong>In the learning activity below, you will be watching two videos on chaos. </strong>As the chaos videos and this image and explanation of the Chinese character for chaos shows <strong>[do you want students to read this article?  When? ]</strong> however, this needn’t be a bad thing – chaos can precede good ideas. Perhaps it’s part of the creative process itself.  This brings us back to Wheatley’s concept of the willingness to be disturbed; the willingness to be confused.  As leaders we should try to ‘get out of our heads’ sometimes and see where our emotions lead.  It is another way of knowing.

<strong>KELLY I HAVE AN IMAGE TO INSERT HERE OF THE CHINESE CHARACTER FOR CHAOS.  IT DOESN'T DISPLAY HERE FOR SOME REASON.  It is linked below and I would like it to display.  Can you help?</strong>

<a href="https://theanalogiesproject.org/the-analogies/chaos-great-dreams-begin/">Here</a> is a relevant interpretation of the <a href="https://goo.gl/cYgiiH">above quote</a>.

<strong>[The link you have is from a Pintrest site, so it will be difficult to track down the original owner of the image.  We should find an open image that we can use. <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?as_st=y&amp;tbm=isch&amp;hl=en&amp;as_q=chinese+character+chaos&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;cr=&amp;as_sitesearch=&amp;safe=images&amp;tbs=sur:fmc">This link</a> is to all chaos image that are cleared for copyright.  <a href="http://www.words-chinese.com/symbols/_chaos.htm">This one</a> shows the different chaos characters.  Please let me know which you'd like to use from the open images.]</strong>

You may find it helpful to take a look at the Reading Response questions posted in week 4 so you can read with these in mind, and, possibly answer the questions concurrently as you read. <strong>[I assume you mean they should read this week's questions?  Also, let's move this to where it relates to the questions.  Activity 3.1 or later?]</strong>

&nbsp;
<h4>Learning Activities
Activity 3.1: View and Reflect</h4>
<strong>[Please confirm that the two videos go here. Any other readings?]</strong>

Below are two videos that will give you a greater understanding of the topic of emotion and teaching.  As you view these resources, consider the following questions: What is your normal reaction to chaos?  How do you manage it?  How might you improve your way of handling chaos?

<h2>Topic 2: Neuroscience and teaching</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
In topic 1 we established that emotions are related to change, innovation and learning. <strong>In this next topic, we discuss how our brains...[can we have a lead in to the topic here?]</strong>

In chapter 11 of the Wang text, Kcenia O’Neil explores the neuroscience behind emotions and learning: “illustrating the interdependency of cognition and emotion in the brain in which emotion is the ‘rudder’ guiding thought in learning” (p.278). As a result, we as adult educators are encouraged to design ways to teach that include more sensory-engaging pedagogies.

This is definitely different from teaching according to Bloom’s taxonomy <strong>[will all learners be familiar with Bloom?  If not, we need to explain or provide a link where students can get more info] </strong>in order to meet learning outcomes and a far cry from teaching via PowerPoint, reading and discussion upon which so much of adult learning is based. With you, I am challenged to explore social-emotional learning and sensory-engaging pedagogies.  How can we incorporate the senses of sight, sound, smell, taste and touch into our teaching? It is a work in progress!

&nbsp;

<strong>[Can we add more to this topic?  Maybe some examples of sensory-engaged pedagogies? Are there any other major ideas in the readings for this topic?  Also, I'm not sure where you wanted the readings, so feel free to move them around - or let me know where to place things]</strong>

&nbsp;
<h4>Learning Activities
Activity 3: Read and Reflect</h4>
As you read the assigned material for this unit listed below, think about this question: Do you have any experience in a teaching and learning setting where you were able to engage with more senses than hearing and seeing? What was it like? Did you feel more engaged through that experience?
<ol>
 	<li>Read: Brookfield, S. (2013).<em> Powerful techniques for teaching adults.</em> (Ch.8)</li>
 	<li>Read: Silberman, M. L., &amp; Biech, E. (2015). <em>Active training: A handbook of techniques, designs, case examples, and tips</em> (4th ed.). (Ch 4-6) Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons</li>
 	<li>Read: Wang, . C. X. (2017). <em>Theory and Practice of Adult and Higher Education</em>. Information Age Publishing Inc. Chapter 11</li>
</ol>
<h4>Activity 3.3: Let's Explore Our Senses!</h4>
<strong>[Adrienne, what do you think about adding another activity here where students can participate in what topic mentions?  For example, perhaps they can watch 10 minutes of a Netflix documentary (or any show), without the sound on to see what they can pick up.  Then rewatch with sound.  Or turn on sound but turn around, picturing what the show describes.  Any other sensory activities?  Another example is for them to eat a meal, and describe what it tastes and feels like to someone that has never experienced that type of food.]</strong>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<h2>Topic 3: <strong>Experiential learning</strong></h2>
<strong>[Can we start the topic with explaining experiential learning? And perhaps more specific examples of teaching using this method?]</strong>

As it relates to <a href="https://learn.twu.ca/mod/url/view.php?id=36739">chaos theory</a> and helping people to find the right fit for a job, Dr. Jim Bright asks the question, “What are we doing to prepare people for uncertainty” (Bright, 2013)? <strong>[Can we restructure this: “What are we doing to prepare people for uncertainty?”(Bright, 2013) Dr. Jim Bright asks the question as it relates to <a href="https://learn.twu.ca/mod/url/view.php?id=36739">chaos theory</a> and helping people to find the right fit for a job. </strong> Bright makes numerous suggestions, a couple of which include networking and pursuing creativity as they navigate their search (Bright, 2013). Predictable fill-in-the-blank answers can seem unreliable and less helpful in uncertain times. <strong>[I don't get how this sentence relates. Is this from Bright, or are we transitioning to talking about teaching?] </strong>Falling along a similar theme, Brookfield pushes educators to look beyond the predicable and measurable in his chapter on <em>Negotiating the Emotions of Powerful Teaching</em>. Referring to questions of pedagogical mechanics Brookfield states, “All these are obviously important questions to ask, but they focus on the outside of teaching as against our inner lives” (Brookfield, 2013, p. 217). <strong>As teachers, w</strong>e need to pay attention to what is happening on the inside.<strong>[of ourselves or of our students?  Can you explain?]</strong> What happens on the inside has a significant impact on our experiences and on the decisions we make and it is a very important part of the learning process. <strong>[maybe give a specific example from teaching?  A case study?]</strong>

As a teacher, Jesus seemed to be more interested in the transformation of a person than their ability to digest content. Jesus provoked discussion. He asked more questions than he answered. Jesus was not afraid to stir things up. He seemed to be okay with <a href="https://learn.twu.ca/mod/resource/view.php?id=36737">change</a>, chance, complexity, and uncertainty. Jesus came with a message of <a href="https://learn.twu.ca/mod/resource/view.php?id=36737">change</a>, and he consistently left people feeling uncertain about the often flimsy realities they had created for themselves. <strong>[Do we need to link to the change PowerPoint for these two words?  It would interrupt the flow of a sentence.  Let me know when/if you want students to view the PowerPoint] </strong>Jesus constantly challenged people to probe deeper, ask more questions, and wrestle with their motivations. It seems that Jesus was quite intentional when it came to preparing people for uncertainty.

Through a more experiential approach to learning, people have the potential to feel more ownership over their experience. Helping the learner to shift from a passive to a more active mode of learning is important for the learner to see how their story connects to the subject at hand. If as educators we are only dispensing knowledge, we may actually limit the growth and development of our learners.  Ultimately it is not about our knowledge but about their transformation.

<strong>Is this where the topic of motivation comes in?</strong>

&nbsp;
<h3>Learning Activities:</h3>
<strong>[Is there any reading for this unit?  Also, can we add more specific tips for students to use emotion in their teaching, or use experiential learning?  If there's a resource that has ideas, let's ask students to jot down 3-5 teaching tips in their notes]</strong>
<h4>Activity 3.3: Questionnaire</h4>
<strong>The following questionnaire is an activity you will complete this week and also in week 6.  As a teacher of adult students, it's important to...[Adrienne, can we explain a bit more of why you included this?  It's a great technique for students to use in their own classes]</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Complete the Critical Incident Questionnaire reflection on your learning and asking for feedback)</li>
 	<li>Submit the questionnaire to Dropbox CIQ <strong>[we'll insert submission instructions later]</strong></li>
</ol>
<strong>Kelly here is the survey - it's good to ask students to complete in weeks 3 and 6 so that adjustments can be made as necessary.  I would have added it to unit 6 but it's not a page yet.  Please help me remember to add it into unit 6. [okay:)]</strong>

<strong>The Classroom Critical Incident Questionnaire</strong>

Please take about ten minutes to respond to the questions below.  If nothing comes to mind for any of the questions just leave the space blank. Thanks for taking the time to do this.  What you write will help me [the instructor] make the class more responsive to your concerns. [<strong>the instructor will be different]</strong>

<strong>Think about your first few weeks of this online class and your experiences in completing the first three units.</strong>
<ol>
 	<li>At what moment in class these few weeks did you feel most engaged with what was happening? <strong>[in class might be confusing, as it's all online, and students may not keep to the weekly schedule.  Perhaps replace with "As you have completed these first three units, at what moment did you feel most engaged with what was happening in the course?]</strong></li>
 	<li>At what moment were you most distanced from what was happening?</li>
 	<li>What action that anyone (teacher or student) took these few weeks did you find most affirming or helpful?</li>
 	<li>What action that anyone took these few weeks did you find most puzzling or confusing?</li>
 	<li>What about the class so far surprised you the most? (This could be about your own reactions to what went on, something that someone did, or anything else that occurs).</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<h2>Unit 3 Summary</h2>
In this unit, you have had the opportunity to learn about the impact of emotions on learning. Hopefully this learning has given you 'permission' to expand the repertoire of teaching methods you draw on so as to elicit an emotional connection between your learners and what you are trying to teach.

&nbsp;

<em><strong>[ Include Assessment button to go to next page ]</strong></em>
<h2>Assessment</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>Write a blog on this topic: Considering how <a href="https://learn.twu.ca/mod/resource/view.php?id=36737">change</a>, chance, complexity and uncertainty impact adult education and life-long learning, what actions can you take to design learning experiences that respect body, spirit, and emotions - as related to your context?</li>
 	<li><strong>Once you have written your post, take some time to find a picture or video that relates to the ideas you have presented.  Add this picture/video to your blog and if it's not evident, explain it's relation to the concepts in this unit.  Be sure to attribute the source of the material by adding a full citation. [Adrienne, what do you think about adding a sensory element to the blog post?  This is just an example]</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Once you have published your blog online, be sure to r</strong>espond to at least two others' blog posts.  <strong>Remember that your comments can include the following to bring depth to the conversation:  </strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>explain why you agree/disagree with an idea</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>relate the blog post to your own experience</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>describe what you like and appreciate about the ideas presented</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>give constructive feedback</strong></li>
</ul>
<strong>[I've added these reminders to give some guidance to students, but feel free to add or delete the bullet points.  Also, we'll include more guidance in Unit 1 when they write/respond to their first post.]</strong>

&nbsp;
