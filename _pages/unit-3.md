&lt;p data-key=&quot;3839&quot;&gt;Kelly here is the survey - it&#039;s good to ask students to complete in weeks 3 and 6 so that adjustments can be made as necessary.  I would have added it to unit 6 but it&#039;s not a page yet.  Please help me remember to add it into unit 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Classroom Critical Incident Questionnaire&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;

Please take about ten minutes to respond to the questions below.  If nothing comes to mind for any of the questions just leave the space blank. Thanks for taking the time to do this.  What you write will help me make the class more responsive to your concerns.

At what moment in class these few weeks did you feel most engaged with what was happening?

At what moment in class these few weeks were you most distanced from what was happening?

What action that anyone (teacher or student) took these few weeks did you find most affirming or helpful?

What action that anyone took these few weeks did you find most puzzling or confusing?

What about the class so far surprised you the most? (This could be about your own reactions to what went on, something that someone did, or anything else that occurs).

Considering how <a href="https://learn.twu.ca/mod/resource/view.php?id=36737">change</a>, chance, complexity and uncertainty impact adult education and life-long learning, what actions can you take to design learning experiences that respect body, spirit, and emotions - as related to your context?

## Topic 1: Emotions and teaching
### Introduction

I want to include parts of a reflection by Margaret Wheatley about the need for us to be disturbed.  Sounds odd but read on! Here is the reference for the full text if you wish to read it verbatim. I’ve adapted it here for our class perspective.

Wheatley, Margaret J. &lt;u&gt;Turning to One Another: Simple Conversations to Restore Hope to the Future &lt;/u&gt;San Francisco: Berrett-Koshler Publishers, Inc., 2002

What does our willingness to be disturbed have to do with adult education?  Well this perspective certainly affects emotions, experience and motivation – the focus of this week’s reading. Our willingness to have our beliefs and ideas challenged by what others think is central to learning as an adult. Adult educators are continual learners that realize we can only find answers by admitting we don’t know. We have to be willing to let go of our certainty and expect ourselves to be confused – at least for awhile.

“Curiosity is what we need. We don’t have to let go of what we believe, but we do need to be curious about what someone else believes. We do need to acknowledge that their way of interpreting the world might be essential to our survival.”

Wheatley also says that “we can’t be creative if we refuse to be confused. Change always starts with confusion; cherished interpretations must dissolve to make way for the new.”  This is ‘disruption’ of our status quo but it can lead to creativity and innovation.  So, don’t be afraid to be confused!

Brookfield (p. 230-231) speaks about ‘anticipatory anxiety’ which is connected to this emotion of confusion discussed by Wheatley.  If we are to foster curiosity and be ok with being confused, we may well get anxious!  That would be natural.  By admitting we don’t know something we may feel like an imposter at work – like we are a permanent rookie or novice who doesn’t really deserve to be doing the work. That too is anxiety provoking!

Brookfield suggests that adult learners and facilitators can deal with these emotions through breathing and bodily exercises, talking it out, and cognitive therapy scripts. People who acknowledge the spiritual in their life - regardless of creed, also have other exercises that can be very helpful, such as prayer. If you go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spiritatwork.com&quot;&gt;www.spiritatwork.com&lt;/a&gt;   you will see some ideas for how to live spirituality at work, in a secular environment. Adult educators can also deliberately incorporate elements of the ‘spiritual’ into the learning experiences they design – not necessarily related to a particular faith but in a way that responds to that emotional, spiritual part of what it means to be human.

Emotions, self-directed learning and transformative learning are connected to the spiritual aspect of what it means to be human. I will now share with you a personal reflection on my thoughts about spirituality as an adult educator.  You may not relate to these and you don’t have to agree, I’m just sharing, as a servant leader, my personal experience.  As adult educators, sharing personal experiences can be a wonderful way to connect with your learners. I hope that is what this accomplishes.

I would describe myself as a thinker. At times, I will say very little while other times I talk to help process.  It depends largely on my emotions at the time and who I am with. Adult educators who try to be servant leaders need to listen well and deeply. For me, deep listening often leads to a &lt;em&gt;gut feeling&lt;/em&gt; about something; that feeling very rarely, if ever, lets me down.  My emotions are no doubt also tied to a belief that I have God-given gifts – and I’m still discovering them. These gifts motivate me to live my mission – to educate for the common good in a way that is just, merciful and humbly rooted in God.  This mission statement comes from Micah 6:8, my favourite scripture: &lt;em&gt;&quot;Do Justice, love mercy and walk humbly with your God.&lt;/em&gt;

As leaders and educators we need to be ‘grounded’ and self-aware so that we understand our emotions, our reactions, triggers and stressors. Part of the way I try to accomplish this is through PRH which is an acronym for the French ‘&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prh-international.org/index.php/en/?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=161&quot;&gt;Personnalite et Relations Humaines’&lt;/a&gt; – Personality and Human Relationships.  It’s been a way to discover both my gifts and who I am truly; deeply. It is a non-denominational international school of education that I have been involved with since 2006.  I find the systematic processes and overall structure to be highly effective personal development. What are the ways you access embodied and spiritual learning? How do you ‘stay grounded’?

The opposite of ‘grounded’ may be restlessness; emotions that are chaotic.  As this image and explanation of the Chinese character for chaos shows however, this needn’t be a bad thing – chaos can precede good ideas. Perhaps it’s part of the creative process itself.  This brings us back to Wheatley’s concept of the willingness to be disturbed; the willingness to be confused.  As leaders we should try to ‘get out of our heads’ sometimes and see where our emotions lead.  It is another way of knowing.

KELLY I HAVE AN IMAGE TO INSERT HERE OF THE CHINESE CHARACTER FOR CHAOS.  IT DOESN&#039;T DISPLAY HERE FOR SOME REASON.  I&#039;LL EMAIL IT TO YOU.

&lt;a href=&quot;https://theanalogiesproject.org/the-analogies/chaos-great-dreams-begin/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a relevant interpretation of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/cYgiiH&quot;&gt;above quote&lt;/a&gt;.

You may find it helpful to take a look at the Reading Response questions posted in week 4 so you can read with these in mind, and, possibly answer the questions concurrently as you read.
