<h2>Unit 3  Experience, Emotions and Motivation</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

In this unit, we explore different ways of knowing - through experience and emotions <strong> - </strong>and consider<strong> </strong>how these impact motivation to learn. Jesus, the greatest teacher of all time, wasn't afraid to be emotional. In Lk 19. 41-42 we hear of His great disappointment and frustration that He cannot help Jerusalem and its people.  The people of Jerusalem do not accept His message of justice and peace.  Jesus is so upset that He weeps.  Part of what bonded Jesus to people was his ability to engage them at a deep level.

This unit invites exploration into how can we bring emotion into our teaching and the science underlying the role of emotion in learning. You may find it helpful to take a look at the Reading Response questions so you can read with these in mind, and, possibly answer the questions concurrently as you read.

&nbsp;

<h3>Topics</h3>

Unit 3 is divided into 3 topics:

Topic 1: Emotions, teaching and learning

<h2>Topic 1: Emotions and teaching</h2>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

There is a need for us to be disturbed - sounds odd, but read on!  Below I've included parts of a reflection by Margaret Wheatley about the need for us to be disturbed in order to learn.  I’ve adapted it here for our class perspective, but click <a href="https://www.ode.state.or.us/opportunities/grants/saelp/willing-to-be-disturbed.pdf">here</a> if you want to read the full text.

What does our willingness to be disturbed have to do with adult education?  Well this perspective certainly affects emotions, experience and motivation – the focus of this week’s reading. Our willingness to have our beliefs and ideas challenged by what others think is central to learning as an adult. Adult educators are continual learners that realize we can only find answers by admitting we don’t know. <em>We have to be willing to let go of our certainty and expect ourselves to be confused – at least for awhile. </em>

In her book, <em>Turning to One Another: Simple Conversations to Restore Hope to the Future</em>, Wheatley states: “Curiosity is what we need. We don’t have to let go of what we believe, but we do need to be curious about what someone else believes. We do need to acknowledge that their way of interpreting the world might be essential to our survival” (Wheatley, 2002, p. 43).

Wheatley also <a href="http://www.margaretwheatley.com/articles/partneringwithconfusion.html">says</a> that “we can’t be creative if we refuse to be confused. Change always starts with confusion; cherished interpretations must dissolve to make way for the new.”  This is ‘disruption’ of our status quo but it can lead to creativity and innovation.  So, don’t be afraid to be confused!

Brookfield (p. 230-231) speaks about ‘anticipatory anxiety’ which is connected to this emotion of confusion discussed by Wheatley.  If we are to foster curiosity and be okay with being confused, we may well get anxious!  That would be natural.  By admitting we don’t know something we may feel like an imposter at work – like we are a permanent rookie or novice who doesn’t really deserve to be doing the work. That too is anxiety provoking!

Brookfield suggests that adult learners and facilitators can deal with these emotions through breathing and bodily exercises, talking it out, and cognitive therapy scripts. People who acknowledge the spiritual in their life - regardless of creed, also have other exercises that can be very helpful, such as prayer. <a href="https://edgewalkers.org/resources/articles-edgewalker-qualities/">Here</a> are some ideas for how to live spirituality at work, in a secular environment. <strong> </strong>Adult educators can also deliberately incorporate elements of the ‘spiritual’ into the learning experiences they design – not necessarily related to a particular faith but in a way that responds to that emotional, spiritual part of what it means to be human.

Emotions, self-directed learning and transformative learning are connected to the spiritual aspect of what it means to be human. As the writer of this course and an adult educator, I would like to share with you a personal reflection on my thoughts about spirituality as an adult educator.  You may not relate to these and you don’t have to agree, I’m just sharing, as a servant leader, my personal experience.  As adult educators, sharing personal experiences can be a wonderful way to connect with your learners. I hope that is what this accomplishes.

I would describe myself as a thinker. At times, I will say very little while other times I talk to help process.  It depends largely on my emotions at the time and who I am with. Adult educators who try to be servant leaders need to listen well and deeply. For me, deep listening often leads to a <em>gut feeling</em> about something; that feeling very rarely, if ever, lets me down.  My emotions are no doubt also tied to a belief that I have God-given gifts – and I’m still discovering them. These gifts motivate me to live my mission – to educate for the common good in a way that is just, merciful and humbly rooted in God.  This mission statement comes from Micah 6:8, my favourite scripture: <em>"Do Justice, love mercy and walk humbly with your God.</em>

As leaders and educators we need to be ‘grounded’ and self-aware so that we understand our emotions, our reactions, triggers and stressors. Understanding emotions is central to communicating clearly in teaching. Part of the way I try to accomplish this is through PRH which is an acronym for the French ‘<a href="http://www.prh-international.org/index.php/en/?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=161">Personnalite et Relations Humaines’</a> – Personality and Human Relationships.  It’s been a way to discover both my gifts and who I am truly; deeply. It is a non-denominational international school of education that I have been involved with since 2006.  I find the systematic processes and overall structure to be highly effective personal development. What are the ways you access embodied and spiritual learning? How do you ‘stay grounded’ and understand your own emotions and, by extension, your learners'?

The opposite of ‘grounded’ may be restlessness; emotions that are chaotic.  In the learning activity below, you will be watching two videos on chaos and reading a <a href="https://theanalogiesproject.org/the-analogies/chaos-great-dreams-begin/">short article</a>.<strong> </strong>As the chaos videos show however, this needn’t be a bad thing – chaos can precede good ideas. Perhaps it’s part of the creative process itself.  This brings us back to Wheatley’s concept of the willingness to be disturbed; the willingness to be confused.  As leaders we should try to ‘get out of our heads’ sometimes and see where our emotions lead.  It is another way of knowing.

You may find it helpful to take a look at the Reading Response questions posted in week 4 so you can read with these in mind, and, possibly answer the questions concurrently as you read.

<h2>Topic 2: Neuroscience and teaching</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

In topic 1 we established that emotions are related to change, innovation and learning. In this next topic, we explore the neuroscience behind emotions and learning.

In chapter 11 of the Wang text, Kcenia O’Neil emphasizes this connection: “illustrating the interdependency of cognition and emotion in the brain in which emotion is the ‘rudder’ guiding thought in learning” (p.278). The<a href="http://bigthink.com/videos/the-amygdala-in-5-minutes"> amygdala</a> is the emotional processor of the brain - if a person is afraid, nervous or anxious, has experienced poverty or trauma brain development is affected and the brain filters out learning. In other words, it is physically impossible to learn. This is important for teachers to know because it affects the kind of environment we need to create for optimal learning. As a result, we as adult educators are encouraged to design ways to teach that include more sensory-engaging pedagogies and take the fear out of learning by creating a welcoming, stress-free learning environment.

This is definitely different from teaching according to<a href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/"> Bloom’s taxonomy</a><strong> </strong>in order to meet learning outcomes and a far cry from teaching via PowerPoint, reading and discussion upon which so much of adult learning is based. With you, I am challenged to explore social-emotional learning and sensory-engaging pedagogies.  How can we incorporate the senses of sight, sound, smell, taste and touch into our teaching? It is a work in progress!

Examples of sensory-engaged teaching methods:

<ul>
    <li>auditory input such as recorded lectures; incorporation of music</li>
    <li>visuals - analysis of videos and film; incorporation of art</li>
    <li>problem-solving through case studies</li>
    <li>storytelling</li>
    <li>place-based learning including learning in nature and other environments</li>
    <li>kinesthetic or movement learning activities eg role play</li>
    <li>activities that incorporate the olfactory (sense of smell) eg. bringing in spices from a region to evoke the culture of food</li>
    <li>Activities that incorporate the sense of touch - textured materials, manipulatives</li>
    <li>discussion forums</li>
    <li>use of interactive technology</li>
</ul>

<h4>Learning Activities
Activity 3: Read and Reflect</h4>

As you read the assigned material for this unit listed below, think about this question: Do you have any experience in a teaching and learning setting where you were able to engage with more senses than hearing and seeing? What was it like? Did you feel more engaged through that experience?

<ol>
    <li>Read: Brookfield, S. (2013).<em> Powerful techniques for teaching adults.</em> (Ch.8)</li>
    <li>Read: Silberman, M. L., &amp; Biech, E. (2015). <em>Active training: A handbook of techniques, designs, case examples, and tips</em> (4th ed.). (Ch 4-6) Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons</li>
    <li>Read: Wang, . C. X. (2017). <em>Theory and Practice of Adult and Higher Education</em>. Information Age Publishing Inc. Chapter 11</li>
</ol>

<strong>Activity 3.1 </strong>

Choose one of the readings for this topic and

a) read while walking

b) read aloud

c) read aloud by walking outside

d) draw a picture or graphic of the information

e) What is the effect of these sensory additions to your reading?

<h2>Topic 3: <strong>Experiential learning</strong></h2>

Corporate trainer, Dave Root defines <a href="https://www.eaglesflight.com/experiential-learning">experiential learning</a> as "immersive activities that mimic real-world challenges with a targeted debrief that connects the lessons learned with the reality of the workplace. It allows participants to learn by doing".  The theory of experiential learning can be traced to philosopher, psychologist and education reformer John Dewey.  It may be surprising to read in Wang (p. 406) that this pragmatic approach to education was  actually innovative for the early twentieth century. Some examples of experiential learning include cooperative education, practicums, internships, studies abroad, field trips, service learning projects, role playing, case studies and simulations. To learn more examples and best practices in experiential learning read this <a href="https://www.ryerson.ca/content/dam/lt/resources/handouts/ExperientialLearningReport.pdf">article</a> from Ryerson University's Learning and Teaching Office.

The result of experiential learning is ideally a deeper understanding of how certain behaviors can influence outcomes and a desire to apply those new behaviors.  This relates to Dewey's (1938) theory of experiential continuum which emphasizes the importance of adults being fully engaged in the experience, making connections to prior experiences and learning how to apply past experiences in new situations.  "For Dewey, then, there are two elements to the learning process - the actual experience which the learner is open to and the reflection upon that experience which builds the continuum of learning (Wang, p. 408).  Since Dewey, Kolb  (1984) contributed to the theory of experiential learning by identifying the learning cycle or spiral as: concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization and active experimentation (Wang p. 409).

Experiential learning helps to prepare people for uncertainly. In the video you watched with Dr. Jim Bright (2013) he<strong> </strong>makes numerous suggestions, a couple of which include networking and pursuing creativity. Through a more experiential approach to learning, people have the potential to feel more ownership over their experience. Helping the learner to shift from a passive to a more active mode of learning is important for the learner to see how their story connects to the subject at hand. If as educators we are only dispensing knowledge, we may actually limit the growth and development of our learners.  Ultimately it is not about our knowledge but about the transformation of our students.

<h3>Learning Activities:</h3>

Read Wang chapter 16 focusing on pages 411-420.

Read this <a href="https://www.ryerson.ca/content/dam/lt/resources/handouts/ExperientialLearningReport.pdf">article</a> from Ryerson University's Learning and Teaching Office.

Taking the above two readings into account, why would an adult learner especially benefit from experiential learning?
Identify 3 activities that could work for your learner population and content.
What challenges might you encounter when integrating experiential learning in your context?

<h4>Activity 3.3: Questionnaire</h4>

The following questionnaire is an activity you will complete this week and also in week 6.  As a teacher of adult students, it's important to understand classroom dynamics and to solicit feedback from learners about what's helping and hindering their learning; when they feel most engaged and least engaged.  The CIQ was developed by Stephen Brookfield and is shared open source on his <a href="http://www.stephenbrookfield.com/ciq/">website</a>.  It's a great technique to use in your own classes.

Complete the Critical Incident Questionnaire reflection on your learning

<strong>Kelly here is the survey - it's good to ask students to complete in weeks 3 and 6 so that adjustments can be made as necessary.  I would have added it to unit 6 but it's not a page yet.  Please help me remember to add it into unit 6. [okay:)]</strong>

<strong>The Classroom Critical Incident Questionnaire</strong>

Please take about ten minutes to respond to the questions below.  If nothing comes to mind for any of the questions just leave the space blank. Thanks for taking the time to do this.  What you write will help the instructor make the class more responsive to your concerns.

<strong>Think about your first few weeks of this online class and your experiences in completing the first three units.</strong>

<ol>
    <li>As you have completed these first three units, at what moment did you feel most engaged with what was happening in the course?</li>
    <li>At what moment were you most distanced from what was happening?</li>
    <li>What action that anyone (teacher or student) took these few weeks did you find most affirming or helpful?</li>
    <li>What action that anyone took these few weeks did you find most puzzling or confusing?</li>
    <li>What about the class so far surprised you the most? (This could be about your own reactions to what went on, something that someone did, or anything else that occurs).</li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

<h2>Unit 3 Summary</h2>

In this unit, you have had the opportunity to learn about the impact of emotions on learning. Hopefully this learning has given you 'permission' to expand the repertoire of teaching methods you draw on so as to elicit an emotional connection between your learners and what you are trying to teach.

&nbsp;

<h2>Assessment</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Write a blog on this topic: Considering how change, chance, complexity and uncertainty impact adult education and life-long learning, what actions can you take to design learning experiences that respect body, spirit, and emotions - as related to your context?</li>
    <li>Once you have written your post, take some time to find a picture or video that relates to the ideas you have presented.  Add this picture/video to your blog and if it's not evident, explain it's relation to the concepts in this unit.  Be sure to attribute the source of the material by adding a full citation.</li>
    <li>Once you have published your blog online, be sure to respond to at least two others' blog posts.</li>
</ol>

<em>Substantive responses may include: </em>

<ul>
    <li>Providing a new thought, idea, or perspective;</li>
    <li>Citing an experience or example of what we are learning;</li>
    <li>Adding a new twist on a perspective;</li>
    <li>Critically thinking about an idea/concept;</li>
    <li>Questioning or challenging a principle/perspective;</li>
    <li>Asking a question or making a comment that shows you are interested in what another person says or encourages another person to elaborate on something they have already said;</li>
    <li>Sharing a resource (a reading, web link, video) not covered in the syllabus that adds new information or perspectives to our learning;</li>
    <li>Making a comment that underscores the link between two people’s contributions and making this link explicit in your comment. Or making a summary observation that takes into account several people’s contributions and that touches on a recurring theme in the discussion.</li>
</ul>

What Substantive Participation is <strong>NOT:</strong>

<ul>
    <li>Very basic comments such as “I agree” or “I disagree;”</li>
    <li>Restating what has been said <em>(unless there is a direct purpose in doing so); </em></li>
    <li>Disrespectfully disagreeing;</li>
    <li>Pat answers that are not thought-provoking or do not move the dialogue forward;</li>
    <li>Greetings/conversation better suited for the Virtual Collegium.</li>
</ul>

Below are examples of how to stimulate your own and others’ thinking:

<ul>
    <li>What would happen if...</li>
    <li>Other times it may be helpful to...</li>
    <li>It is my understanding...what is your experience with this?</li>
    <li>You might approach this from...</li>
    <li>Is it possible that...</li>
    <li>Would you consider...</li>
    <li>Maybe...</li>
    <li>Possibly...</li>
    <li>Sometimes...</li>
    <li>I'm wondering if...</li>
