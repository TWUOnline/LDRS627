Learning Cafe

You will notice that there is a 'Learning Cafe' section on the site. This is a place for you to interact about things going on, share resources and generally get to know one another.  Your posts don't have to be course related.  Some units may have prompts for you to share your thoughts and ideas with your peers.  Take this opportunity to connect with fellow learners and learn from one another!

<strong>Kelly to add the following to weeks 4, 6, 8, 10</strong>

<strong>Learning Cafe </strong>

<strong>Before you continue with Unit ..., take a couple minutes to connect with other learners in the Learning Cafe.  This week, use the following prompt</strong> <strong>to get a new</strong> conversation going:

If you received $5,000 as a gift, how would you spend it?

In 30 words or less, how would you describe yourself to someone who does not know you?  OR • If someone were to write a book about you, what would the title be?  <strong>(Kelly please give both choices.)</strong>

What do you like to do in your spare time?

If you could take only three people with you on a trip around the world, who would you take with you?
