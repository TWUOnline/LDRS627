<h2><strong>Assessment</strong></h2>
<h3>Assignment: Blog Post</h3>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Part A:</strong> In SMART format, and colour coded with a legend (eg S = one colour, M = a different colour etc) write one affective, one behavioural and one cognitive goal that you have for taking this course. Comment on how writing clear goals for yourself about this course might impact your performance and motivation. Respond to at least two others’ blogs.  See if you can clearly determine the ‘SMARTness’ of their goals. Your comments may be to ask them more about their personal goals and any connections to what they have identified.</li>
 	<li><strong>Part B: </strong>In SMART format, and colour coded with a legend (eg S = one colour, M = a different colour etc) write two objectives for each goal. Comment on how writing clear objectives might encourage individual progress monitoring.</li>
 	<li><strong>Part C:</strong> Describe an activity, exercise or learning moment that you have experienced that lead to more personal awareness, empowerment, higher self-esteem and personal significance.</li>
</ul>
