<h2>Digital Inquiry at TWU</h2>
Planning notes and resources for TWU Digital Inquiry Lab.
<h3>What if I told you that learning management systems like Moodle are making it harder for your students to learn?</h3>
That's a bold and provocative question in some circles, but give me a few minutes and maybe you will see some disadvantages to the <em>status quo</em>.

LMSs are good for some things in education, but their name (at least in North America) belies their true utility. Ultimately, they are management systems. They make it easier for administrators and faculty to manage some logistics related to educational environments. They allow faculty to access an official roster for their class in any given semester; they are great file repositories for syllabi and PowerPoints; they allow for some efficiencies in assigning, receiving, grading and providing feedback on student work; and they have generally useful gradebook record-keeping features.

But there are some areas where they are less than useful, perhaps even more than less than useful.
<ul>
 	<li>building and maintaining a community of learners over time</li>
 	<li>allowing students to maintain ownership and control of their work</li>
 	<li>encouraging connections and interactions outside the system</li>
 	<li>sharing new knowledge with 'the public'</li>
 	<li>building connections between ideas in different courses or disciplines</li>
 	<li>supporting renewable assignments</li>
</ul>
It is these limitations that have me thinking about a broader concept of a digital learning environment at TWU. When we get locked into thinking about digital technologies as one-size-fits-all, we end up with one-size-fits-none.
<h3>What is Digital Pedagogy?</h3>
There are a growing number of people thinking and writing about digital pedagogy like <a href="http://www.seanmichaelmorris.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sean Michael Morris</a>, <a href="http://www.jessestommel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jesse Stommel</a>, <a href="https://pushpullfork.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kris Shaffer</a>, <a href="http://theory.cribchronicles.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bonnie Stewart</a>, <a href="https://blog.mahabali.me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maha Bali</a>, and others.

At the bottom of it all, despite the wide variety of opinion on the matter, is the idea that learning in digital environments can be fundamentally different from learning in f2f environments. This is because of what many call the affordances of digital learning environments.

For example, in a f2f environment, the discussion that happens in the classroom, in the form of small groups or a full-class conversation, is ephemeral. It is gone as soon as the words are spoken. A f2f discussion privileges those who are bold and outspoken at the expense of those who think deeply about ideas and take time to formulate thoughts.

In a digital environment, these same conversations persist in the form of posts, reactions, artifacts, and domains. This persistence allows for people to interact more deeply with those ideas and to create their own riffs on them as they integrate new ideas into old. Further, the asynchronicity of many digital learning environments allows those who need time to process to participate when their thoughts are more fully formed.

Digital pedagogy is the art of creating effective learning activities for students in digital environments.

This workshop is to help you explore and experiment with some digital activities, and we are not going to talk about discussion forums.
