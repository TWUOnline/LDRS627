<h1><strong>Unit 4: Goals and Objectives</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
When planning a lesson, it is important to set clear learning targets in three areas: affective, cognitive and behavioral. Doing so provides learners with clarity of what is expected and also helps limit and focus the amount of material you will try to teach. Clear goals and objectives also help to manage, monitor and evaluate the training.

Setting learning targets should happen with consideration of learners’ needs.  If possible, a pre-assessment is advisable, such as pre-tests or simple questions asked in class. Alternatively, try to find out about the general profile of the learners who will be in your class so that you can plan accordingly for relevant learning experiences. Once you have an idea of what the learners’ needs are and the content and skills that the organization desires to be addressed, you can set goals and objectives.  Setting the goals and objectives prior to designing the learning opportunities ensures more alignment and helps to avoid ‘activitizing’, that is, doing activities that are not connected to the learning outcomes because they are fun, you have the resources etc.

When writing goals and objectives there is a format to follow to ensure you are specific about what you want participants to learn and the results you want to achieve. The format you will learn and practice in this unit follows the <a href="https://www.smartsheet.com/blog/essential-guide-writing-smart-goals">SMART</a> OR SMARTER acronym, which we will discuss in Topic 1.
