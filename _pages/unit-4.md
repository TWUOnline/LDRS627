<h1><strong>Unit 4: Goals and Objectives</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>

When planning a lesson, it is important to set clear learning targets in three areas: affective, cognitive and behavioral. Doing so provides learners with clarity of what is expected and also helps limit and focus the amount of material you will try to teach. Clear goals and objectives also help to manage, monitor and evaluate the training.

Setting learning targets should happen with consideration of learners’ needs.  If possible, a pre-assessment is advisable, such as pre-tests or simple questions asked in class. Alternatively, try to find out about the general profile of the learners who will be in your class so that you can plan accordingly for relevant learning experiences. Once you have an idea of what the learners’ needs are and the content and skills that the organization desires to be addressed, you can set goals and objectives.  Setting the goals and objectives prior to designing the learning opportunities ensures more alignment and helps to avoid ‘activitizing’, that is, doing activities that are not connected to the learning outcomes because they are fun, you have the resources etc.

When writing goals and objectives there is a format to follow to ensure you are specific about what you want participants to learn and the results you want to achieve. The format you will learn and practice in this unit follows the <a href="https://www.smartsheet.com/blog/essential-guide-writing-smart-goals">SMART</a> OR SMARTER acronym, which we will discuss in Topic 1.

<strong>Activity Checklist</strong>

Here is a checklist of learning activities you will benefit from in completing this unit. You may find it useful for planning your work.

<ol>
    <li>Read Silberman, M. L., &amp; Biech, E. (2015). <em>Active training: A handbook of techniques, designs, case examples, and tips (4th ed.).</em> Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons (Pages 13-18 and Chap. 1)</li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

<ol start="2">
    <li>Write a Blog Post In SMART format, and colour coded with a legend (eg S = one colour, M = a different colour etc) write one affective, one behavioural and one cognitive goal that you have for taking this course. Comment on how writing clear goals for yourself about this course might impact your performance and motivation. Respond to at least two others’ blogs.  See if you can clearly determine the ‘SMARTness’ of their goals. Your comments may be to ask them more about their personal goals and any connections to what they have identified.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
    <li>Write a Blog Post In SMART format, and colour coded with a legend (eg S = one colour, M = a different colour etc) write two objectives for each goal. Comment on how writing clear objectives might encourage individual progress monitoring.</li>
</ol>
