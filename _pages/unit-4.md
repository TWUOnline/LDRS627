<!--themify_builder_static--><h1>Unit 4<br />Goals and Objectives</h1>
 <p>When planning a lesson, it is important to set clear learning targets in three areas: affective, cognitive and behavioral. Doing so provides learners with clarity of what is expected and also helps limit and focus the amount of material you will try to teach. Clear goals and objectives also help to manage, monitor and evaluate the training.</p>
