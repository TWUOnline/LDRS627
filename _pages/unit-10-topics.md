<strong>Introduction</strong>

Brookfield addresses teaching using the creative arts in chapter 7. As a graduate student you can relate to the idea of "living in your head." Think about ways to incorporate other expressions beyond the linguistic into your life. “What art offers us is a chance of breaking with the familiar, of inducing in us an awareness of other ways of being in the world” (p. 187). Art encourages us to slow down, take a deep breath and use our senses to really appreciate the amazing world that we have around us.

I have been fortunate to visit several wonderful art galleries in beautiful cities around the world. In these places I find myself surrounded by beauty, both natural and human-made. The experience for me is the epitome of using the senses to capture artistry in its highest form. Our own Vancouver Art Gallery is surrounded by a city close to mountains and beaches. The architecture in the city is also stunning. I hope you have had the opportunity to enjoy create arts in many forms and let this infuse your inspiration as you design learning opportunities.

Committing to beauty is perhaps an unusual call to action for adult educators, but it can be an effective tool. “Beauty appeals to what is good in us”<a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1">[i]</a>– not manufactured or superficial beauty focused on the self, but a natural or created beauty that inspires to innovation, creativity, love, generosity, sacrifice and selflessness.  An adult educator can empower and inspire motivation for a common good or shared vision through beauty in language (speech, poetry, literature), the visual and performing arts, music, prayer and ritual.  There is power in art, music, literature and nature that leads to wonder and gives us a clearer vision into the depths of reality.  Those who experience them can become moved towards unity, fullness and community.

Here are a few ways you could incorporate the aesthetic into your training even if, like me, you don't consider yourself particularly "artistic:"
<ul>
 	<li>Play music as students enter the room to set the tone; experiment with various genres of music.</li>
 	<li>Display an image of a photograph or art piece and ask students to connect the topic of the lesson to it metaphorically.</li>
 	<li>Use image association: say a word related to the lesson and ask what image comes to students' minds.</li>
 	<li>Ask students to create a collage using magazine pictures, online images or small objects.</li>
 	<li>Create a group collage or "quilt." Gather the individual collages onto a common black background.</li>
 	<li>Ask students to create found poems summarizing their understanding of the material. Found poetry weaves selected words and phrases from research reports into poetry</li>
 	<li>Incorporate role play or theater.</li>
 	<li>Ask students to take pictures that evoke for them one or more of the concepts studied. These can be made into a slideshow for presentation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Activity 10.1: Reading</h2>
Read Brookfield, S. (2013). <em>Powerful techniques for teaching adults</em>. (Ch. 7)

In your notes, jot down other ways could you incorporate the aesthetic into your training.

&nbsp;
<h2>Activity 10.2: Reflect &amp; Respond</h2>
In your notes consider your personal response to this portion of the introductory notes to topic 1:

“An adult educator can empower and inspire motivation for a common good or shared vision through beauty in language (speech, poetry, literature), the visual and performing arts, music, prayer and ritual.  There is power in art, music, literature and nature that leads to wonder and gives us a clearer vision into the depths of reality.  Those who experience them can become moved towards unity, fullness and community.”

<h1>Topic 2: Team Learning</h1>
<strong> </strong>

<strong>Introduction</strong>

I would like to share with you a quote related to this week’s theme of team learning. I find this meaningful not only to this week but as an excellent way to conclude, from a servant-leadership perspective, this threshold course on adult learning.

“Life needs to link with other life, to form relationships where all individuals are better supported by the system they have created. It is impossible to look at the natural world and find an individual…Everywhere we look, we see complex, tangled, messy webs of relationships. From these relationships, life creates systems that offer greater stability and support than life lived alone. Organisms shape themselves in response to their neighbors and their environments. All respond to one another, coevolving and co-creating the complex systems of organization that we see in nature. Life is systems-seeking. It seeks organization. Organization is a naturally occurring phenomenon. Self-organization is a powerful force that creates systems we observe and that testifies to a world that knows how to organize from the inside out. (Quoted in Spears, 1997, <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Insights+on+Leadership%3A+Service%2C+Stewardship%2C+Spirit%2C+and+Servant+Leadership-p-9780471176343"><em>Insights on Leadership: Service, Stewardship, Spirit, and Servant-Leadership</em></a>. New York, NY: John Wiley &amp; Sons. pp. 346-47)

This emphasis on relationships and interdependence in the natural world relates to the arena of adult education since it focuses on processes that empower people and bring us together in positive relationship. Educating is not about "lording it over" others, seeking greatness or power. Rather it is about developing others to be the best they can be, relating to them as individuals with dignity, caring enough to prepare and deliver competently according to need and without discrimination.

<strong> </strong>
<h2>Activity 10.3: Reading</h2>
Read Silberman, M. L., &amp; Biech, E. (2015). <em>Active training: A handbook of techniques, designs, case examples, and tips (4th ed.)</em>. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons (Ch.14)

&nbsp;

What ways to promote team learning most resonate with you?

<strong> </strong>
<h2>Activity 10.4: Reading</h2>
&nbsp;

Read Wang, C. X. (2017). <em>Theory and Practice of Adult and Higher Education</em>. Information Age Publishing Inc. Chapter 9.

How might mentoring relationships impact collaborative learning in your context?

<h1>Topic 3: Adult Educator Competencies</h1>
<strong> </strong>

<strong>Introduction</strong>

The <a href="https://lincs.ed.gov/publications/te/competencies.pdf">Adult Education Teacher Competencies</a> from the American Institutes for Research identifies the knowledge and skills expected of any adult education teacher. Consider the professional development activities that will help you acquire these competencies.  There are four domains that represent broad areas of activity for an adult education teacher:
<ol>
 	<li>Monitors and manages student learning and performance through data.</li>
 	<li>Plans and delivers high-quality, evidence-based instruction.</li>
 	<li>Effectively communicates to motivate and engage learners.</li>
 	<li>Pursues professionalism and continually builds knowledge and skills.</li>
</ol>
Within those four domains of activity, 17 individual, observable competencies represent the knowledge, skills, and abilities that an adult education instructor should possess to be effective within that domain. Each domain has four to five competencies. Each competency has a set of indicators that articulate what the performance of this competency looks like in an adult education context. Each performance indicator is accompanied by a sample illustration that provides examples of the practice in different adult education settings (p. 3).

Keep in mind that this document does not address competencies related to content. Each discipline or area of training will require unique content competencies.  There are also dispositions of an adult educator that are not covered by this document. As you review it, consider your context and the content and dispositions you need to develop and foster in order to be most effective.

<strong> </strong>
<h2>Activity 10.5: Self-Assessment</h2>
See the following interactive graphic for more details on the competencies: <a href="https://lincs.ed.gov/publications/te/competenciesgraphic.pdf">https://lincs.ed.gov/publications/te/competenciesgraphic.pdf</a>.

Then, take the self-assessment at <a href="https://lincs.ed.gov/publications/te/self-assessment.html">https://lincs.ed.gov/publications/te/self-assessment.html</a>.  What competencies do you feel you are proficient at, and which ones need improvement?

<strong> </strong>
<h2>Activity 10.6: Blog Assignment (%)</h2>
Write a blog commenting on three of the competencies of adult educators described in Adult Education Teacher Competencies.  What is significant about each of these?  What is going to be your top growth area or focus as you embark on refining your skill set in this field?  (This may be one of the three or a different competency.)

&nbsp;

Make a personal growth plan for the top growth area or focus you identified.  Use the SMART goals <a href="https://www.smartsheet.com/blog/essential-guide-writing-smart-goals">template</a> and include this with your blog as a public commitment to your growth.

&nbsp;
<h2>Activity 10.7: Learning Design Assignment (30%)</h2>
Submit your revised Adult Learning Design Assignment.

Sketch out the design of one lesson or session of 3-6 hours length that will be useful to you in your work. It may be a formal lesson within an educational institution or a (corporate) training program.

Your design document will utilize the following organizational structure: (use titles)

Institutional Context (Where?)

Intents (Why?)
<ul>
 	<li>Problem Identification</li>
 	<li>Learner Analysis</li>
 	<li>Learning Outcomes/Objectives</li>
 	<li>Integration of Transformational Servant Leadership and Values Based Leadership.</li>
</ul>
Activities (How?)

Learning Activity (What?)

Program Sequence (When?)

Resources (With What?)

Assessment (What was Learned?)

Use the course textbooks to guide your thinking and structure the content within each of the above sections.
